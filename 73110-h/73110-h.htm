<small>SHEPHERD’S INN, FLEET STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Northcote</span> sat in his chambers in Shepherd’s
Inn. Down below was Fleet Street, in the thrall of
a bitter December twilight. A heavy and pervasive
thaw pressed its mantle upon the gaslit air; a
driving sleet numbed the skin and stung the eyes
of all who had to face it. Pools of slush, composed
in equal parts of ice, water, and mud, impeded
the pavements. They invaded the stoutest
boots, submerged those less resolute, and imposed
not a little inconvenience upon that section of the
population which, unaddicted to the wearing of
boots, had dispensed with them altogether.</p>

<p>The room in which Northcote kept was no more
than a large and draughty garret, which abutted
from the northern end of a crazy rectangular building
on this curious byway of the world’s affairs.
Only a few decrepit tiles, a handful of rotten laths,
and a layer of cracked plaster intervened between
him and the night. The grate had no fire in it;
there was no carpet to the floor. A table and two
chairs were the sole furniture, and in a corner
could be heard the stealthy drip of icy water as it
percolated through the roof.</p>

<p>The occupant of the room sat in a threadbare
overcoat with the collar turned up to his ears. His
hands, encased in a pair of woollen gloves, which
were full of holes, were pressed upon his knees;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a pipe was between his teeth; and while he sucked
at it with the devout patience of one to whom it has
to serve for everything that the physical side of his
nature craved, he stared into the fireless grate with
an intensity which can impart a heat and a life of
its own.</p>

<p>Now and again after some particularly violent
demonstration on the part of the weather he would
give a little stoical shudder, fix the pipe in the opposite
corner of his mouth, and huddle away involuntarily
from the draught that came from under the
door.</p>

<p>Northcote was a man of thirty who found himself
face to face with starvation. He had been six
years at the bar. Friendless, without influence, abjectly
poor, he had chosen the common law side.
Occasionally he had been able to pick up an odd
guinea in the police-courts, but at no time had he
earned enough to meet his few needs. He was now
contemplating the removal of the roof from over
his head. Its modest rental was no longer forthcoming;
and there was nothing remaining among
his worldly possessions which would induce the
pawnbroker, the friend of the poor, to advance it.</p>

<p>“I wonder how those poor devils get on who
live in the gutter,” he muttered, grimly, as he
shuddered again. “You will soon be able to find
an answer to that question,” he added, as he
stamped his frozen toes on the hearthstone and
beat his fingers against his knees.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly he was lifted out of the abyss of
his reflection by the sound of a footfall in the
room. Jerking up his head, he peered through the
darkness towards the door whence the sound had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
come, but the shadows were so thick that he could
see nothing.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he called.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” came back a wholly unexpected response.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want?” cried
Northcote, with a thrill in his voice.</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet to summon the
commoner faculties. For a voice to have invaded
his garret at this hour and in this fashion seemed
to presage a new epoch to his life.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded again, having
received no reply to the former demand.</p>

<p>“Nobody much,” said the voice, which sounded
unlike anything he had ever heard before.</p>

<p>“I’ll strike a match before I get a blow from
a bludgeon.”</p>

<p>“Pray do so,” said the voice, quietly.</p>

<p>Northcote began to fumble for the matches and
found them on the mantelpiece. He obtained a
light and applied it to the wick of the lamp which
was on the table, and was then able to read his
visitor.</p>

<p>The flicker of the lamp declared him to be a man
of forty, of pale and attenuated figure, clad in rags.</p>

<p>“To what am I indebted for the honor of this
visit?” said Northcote, with slightly overemphasized
politeness.</p>

<p>“Curiosity, curiosity,” muttered his visitor, with
the quietness of one who is acquainted with its
value.</p>

<p>Northcote turned up the lamp to its highest point
and resumed his scrutiny. The voice and manner
were those of a man of education; and although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the garb was that of a scarecrow, and the face was
wan with hunger and slightly debased by suffering,
a strange refinement was underlying it.</p>

<p>“This is all very mysterious,” said the young
advocate; and indeed the wretched figure that confronted
him appeared to have no credentials to
present. “May I ask who and what you are?”</p>

<p>“How race reveals itself!” said the visitor, with
a faint air of disappointment. “Even the higher
types among us cannot cast their shackles away.
When we go down into Hades, we are at once
surrounded by the damned souls of our countrymen,
clamoring to know <i>who</i> and <i>what</i> we
are.”</p>

<p>“Well, who are <i>you</i>, at any rate?” said Northcote,
oppressed with an acute sense of mystery.</p>

<p>“My name is Iggs,” said the scarecrow.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Iggs, I am sorry to say that to me
your name conveys nothing.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>For an instant the scarecrow peered in a strange
and concentrated manner into the face of the advocate.
He then sighed deeply and rose from his
chair.</p>

<p>“With all the learning we acquire so painfully,”
he whispered, “we cannot enjoy a perfect immunity
from error. Good night, sir. I offer my apologies
for having invaded your privacy.”</p>

<p>With a bow of grave deference the strange figure
proceeded to glide from the room in the noiseless
manner in which it had entered it.</p>

<p>By the time his visitor had reached the door,
Northcote called after him hastily: “Come back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Mr. Iggs. I have not expressed myself—not expressed
myself adequately. Come back.”</p>

<p>His visitor, with the same air of deference and
the same noiselessness of movement, returned to
the chair. Northcote fixed two eyes of a
devouring curiosity upon his bloodless face. They
recoiled with a shock of encounter; two orbs flaming
out of it in all their sunken brilliancy had looked
within them. Also he beheld a mouth whose lips
were curved with the divine mobility of a passion.
The advocate clasped his hands to his sides to
repress a fierce emotion of pain.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Mr. Iggs,” he said, “you have been
down into the depths of the sea?”</p>

<p>His visitor brushed the green canopy of his
mutilated bowler hat slowly and delicately upon
the threadbare sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said; “but I would have you
not forget that I have also walked upon the peaks
of the highest mountains.”</p>

<p>The roar of Fleet Street, the sough of the icy
wind through the telegraph wires, the driving of
the sleet against the window, and the drip drip of
the water through the ceiling seemed to blend with
the rich and full tones enveloping these words. A
sensation of awe began to surmount the pity and
the patronage that the outer semblance of his
visitor had first aroused in the breast of the young
man.</p>

<p>“With your permission, sir,” he said, “I will go
back to my original question, and I will frame it
with a deeper sincerity: To what does Henry
Northcote owe the honor of this visit?”</p>

<p>“This visit is paid to you, my friend, because for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
some inscrutable reason Nature mixed blood and
fire with your brains. You, too, will go down into
the depths of the sea and ascend also into the mountain
places.”</p>

<p>“You cannot know that,” said Northcote, with
his heart beginning to beat violently.</p>

<p>“Reflect a moment,” said his visitor. “Do you
not know as well as I that it is the privilege of us
to know everything?”</p>

<p>“True, true! But in what manner has one so
obscure as myself been brought to your notice?”</p>

<p>“Every Sunday afternoon for a year past I have
been a member of the audience your oratory has
enchanted in Hyde Park.”</p>

<p>“How comes it, sir, that one of your condition
can bring himself to listen to a mob orator?”</p>

<p>“How comes it that one of a like condition can
bring himself to preach to the mob?”</p>

<p>“Primarily, I suppose, that my powers may develop.
One day I shall hope to turn them—that
is, if it is given to me to survive the present snap
of cold weather—to higher things and larger issues.”</p>

<p>“And I, my friend,” said his visitor, “who by
no human possibility can survive the present snap
of cold weather, I come to tell the young
Demosthenes that he can seek no higher thing, no larger
issue than to preach to the mob. All the great movements
the world ever saw began from below. The
power of the sea lies in its depths. Jesus was able
to invent a religion by preaching to the mob.”</p>

<p>“There are some who think,” said the young
man, “that for one who was ambitious the career
of Jesus was a partial failure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“The age is crying out for another such failure,”
said his visitor.</p>

<p>“Because the old has betrayed them?” said the
young man, with fear in his voice.</p>

<p>His visitor left the question unanswered.</p>

<p>“They await the advent,” he said, after a silence
in which both breathed close, “of a second Failure
to save them from themselves. Only that can prevent
them dashing out their brains against the blank
wall that has come to stand before them.”</p>

<p>“I believe you to be right, sir,” said the advocate,
slowly, as his eyes traversed the chaste delicacy of
the face which was framed in shadows.</p>

<p>“The Great Renunciator who first reduces this
failure to terms,” said the scarecrow, “will have a
sterner task than Jesus had.”</p>

<p>“Yet, sir, you come to one who is almost fainting
by the bleak wayside.”</p>

<p>“Have I not listened to your oratory? Do I
not discern you to stand at the parting of the
ways?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at the parting of the ways,” said the young
man heavily. “The hour is at hand when one
whose poverty is bitter must make his choice.”</p>

<p>“I have prayed for you,” said his visitor, with
such a perfect simplicity that it filled the eyes of
the young advocate with tears. “Your ordeal is
terrible, for I discern you to be a man of great
power.”</p>

<p>“Poverty is a deadly evil,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“Yet I would have you beware of riches,” said
his visitor. “Think of the cruel treachery with
which they use so many. See how they have betrayed
our own fair land. And it is one such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
you, in his virgin immunity, who is called upon to
release her from their false embraces.”</p>

<p>“I, sir!” exclaimed the young man, with wild
eyes and his heart beating violently. “I, without
clothes to my skin, without food in my belly, and
who to-morrow will have no roof under which to
rest his head!”</p>

<p>The wan smile of the scarecrow embraced his
own mutilated hat, broken boots, and ragged condition.</p>

<p>“You may or you may not be the emancipator,”
said the scarecrow, peering at him earnestly, “yet
the veritable great one whom I see configured before
me is some such man as you. I have listened
many weeks to your oratory, and you have a
strange power. Your voice is noble, and speaks
words of authority. Even if you are not the demigod
for whom the age is asking,—and, my dear
friend, far be it from me to say you are not,—you
were yet formed by Nature to do a momentous
work for your country.”</p>

<p>“In its casual wards,” said the young man, with
an outburst of bitterness.</p>

<p>“The elect upon whom Nature confers true
power are generally safeguarded in this wise manner.
The ambitions of the market-place are set
beyond their reach. I lie down to-night with a
p an of thanksgiving upon my lips. May the hour
dawn when you also may consign your bones to
the snow. But in the meantime you have a great
work to do in the world. Nature has filled you
with speech; therefore you have the burden of immense
responsibilities, for speech is the most signal
of her gifts. You may or you may not be the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
renunciator whom millions of your countrymen
await with fevered looks; but it lies within your
province, as it lies within that of every mariner,
to array yourself among those of humble prophecy
who read the meaning of the star in the east. At
least, my friend, all who allow themselves to anticipate
a divine appearance are the servants of truth.”</p>

<p>With these words the scarecrow rose from his
chair, and, bowing to the young man with an austere
but kind dignity, left the room as suddenly and
noiselessly as he had entered it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br>

<small>RETROSPECTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Left</span> alone in the coldness of his garret, Northcote
felt a stupefaction steal upon him. The phase
of his own circumstances had lent force to this
bizarre incident. Spectral as this apparition was,
however, the gestures, the tones, the mean garb
were those of a living man.</p>

<p>The coming of such a mariner who had been
down into the depths of the sea appeared for a
moment to turn his eyes inwards. Seated again
before the empty grate with his hands on his knees,
he saw his life and its surroundings with a sharpness
of vision which hunger had seemed to render
more definite. He saw himself as the full-blooded
turbulent man, tormented by desires, thwarted by
fortune, yet yearning to express a complete, moral,
intellectual, and physical life. He was so strong,
yet so impotent; so expansive, yet so circumscribed;
loving all the colors of the sun and the bright face
of heaven, yet condemned to a prison, and perhaps
the more dreadful darkness of the lazar-house. He
saw himself as the wholesome, simple-hearted citizen,
yet as the man of imagination also, the poet
and the dreamer formed to walk upon the heights,
who, oppressed by the duality of his nature, was in
danger of succumbing to weariness, disillusion, and
a remorseless material need.</p>

<p>He saw himself as a boy roaming the fields, casting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
up the soft loam with his feet, spending long
days in dreams of the miraculous future, and evenings
in conversation with his mother,—that wonderful
mother whose mind was so secure, whose
conceptions of the heavy duties that wait upon the
gift of life were so odd, yet so exact. He recalled
her as a gaunt, strong, and tall woman, with a red
face, rather coarse hands, and a shabby black hat
tied in a frayed velvet bow under her chin.</p>

<p>He could never remember to have heard her complain
of life and fortune. She wore the same clothes
year after year; sought no amelioration from her
wearisome and unremitting labors; never seemed to
vary in her sturdiness of health and temper; and
always maintained plain, robust, material opinions.
Her life had been a sordid and continuous struggle
for the acquisition of money, a pound here and a
pound there, but there was no trace of avarice in her
character. She had educated him wholly beyond
her means, but permitted herself no romance about
it. She believed that being her son, and the son
of the man she had married,—whom life had cut
off in an arbitrary manner before he had had a
chance to display his gifts,—he would be a man
of sound abilities. She had decided in her own
mind three months before he was born that to have
a fair field for his talents he must go to the bar.</p>

<p>“I have a little imagination, but not enough,”
she would say to him, as he sat with her an hour
after supper in the winter evenings. “Your father
was a man of good imagination, and used to read
the best authors to me. My mental limitations did
not permit me to understand their truth, but I always
felt their power. Your father was a brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
man in some ways, but the clock of his intellect was
always set a little too fast. If he had not decided
early in life to be a bishop, I think he would have
been a writer of books. Even as it was, he wanted
sometimes to write them. However, I managed to
dissuade him. ‘No, Henry,’ I said, ‘stick to your
trade. You cannot combine the two. To write
books you would have to look at things so closely
that it would unfit you for your calling.’ All the
same, your father was a man of remarkable natural
force. He would have succeeded in anything he
had undertaken.”</p>

<p>Northcote never recalled his mother—and it was
seldom that a day passed in his life unless he did
recall her in one shape or another—that this speech,
and a hundred that were similar, did not fill his ears,
his memory, and his imagination. As he sat now
with his hands and feet growing colder, the pool
on the floor growing larger, his vitality becoming
less and with despair advancing upon him silently
like the army of shadows that pressed every minute
more strongly upon the feeble lamp, he saw that
dauntless countenance, the firm lips, the gray eyes
which darkened a little in the evenings as though
accompanied by thought; the precise but inharmonious
voice came into his ears; the vigorous
intelligence was spread before him, calm but unbeautiful,
full of massive courage, but deficient in
the finer shades of life.</p>

<p>At those seasons when the young advocate sat
in his isolation and despair, that arch-enemy of high
natures crept into his veins like a drug; he would
seek the antidote in that courageous life. This penniless
widow of a clergyman in a small village in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
a remote part of the world had fitted her son for
the only sphere in which she looked for distinction
for him, by many years of Spartan hardihood in
thought and deed. The few pounds the Reverend
Henry Northcote had laid by from his pittance,
wherewith to provide an education for his son, had
been lost in a building society within three months
of his own departure from the world. From the
date of the disaster his widow had restricted the
hours she spent in bed to five out of the twenty-four;
had renounced the eating of meat and the
most commonplace luxuries; and had practised a
thousand and one petty economies in order that
her husband’s son should not lack the educational
advantages of those with whom he would have to
compete. She had maintained him at a public
school, and afterwards, for a short period, at the
university, by translating classics out of foreign languages
for scholastic publishers, and by conveying
the rudiments of knowledge to the young children
of the landholders who lived in her neighborhood.</p>

<p>This stalwart figure formed a wonderful background
to his youth. He was filled with awe by
a simplicity that was so unconquerable, a self-reliance
that was so majestic. All the subtle implements
of his nature could not resolve such a potency as
that. He himself was so much less and so much
more.</p>

<p>Strange homage was paid to this unlovely but
august woman by the privy council which sat in
eternal session in his intellect. The favorite guise
in which she was presented to it was as the mother
of Napoleon, that “Madame Mère” who in the
trenches conceived the Man of Destiny, and walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to church an hour before she gave him to the world.
Her martial bearing, large bones, strong country
speech, clothed the idea with the flesh of the hard
fact; her consciousness of purpose, power of will,
ennobled and quickened it with the hues of poetry.</p>

<p>Homer must have had some such woman for a
mother, in whose womb the Iliads were born prenatally.
All that sped, flew, or swam in the a rial
kingdom of the Idea must first have had its pinions
fixed and pointed by some inarticulate goddess who
laid upon herself the humblest functions, the meanest
offices, in order that nature might not lack lusty
and shrewd servants in the time to be. The teeming
millions of creatures who spawned in the darkness,
who lifted their scaled eyes to where the light might
be found, according to those who had skill in
prophecy, yet who themselves were so uncertain of
its presence that, when it shone straight before them
through the fissures in their cave, they passed it by
as a chimera, or the iridescence of some bird, reptile,
piece of coal, or winged snake,—these cried
out continually for some true-born Child of the Sun
to lead them out of that gross night into the molten
plains of beauty which ran down to the sea. And
it was given to some stalwart creature with a red
face and coarse hands and a shabby black hat tied
in a bow under the chin, who herself was purblind,
yet with knees ever pressed to the flags of the temple,
to dream of the light in her prayers, and presently,
out of her own strong, rustic body, to furnish
forth to her kind a guide, a prophet, and a leader.</p>

<p>As hunger, that exquisite, but cruel, sensation,
grew upon Northcote, and caused fierce little
shivers to run through his bones, he awoke to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
fact that all the tobacco in his pipe had been consumed,
and further, that there was not a grain
left in his pouch. In this extremity he had recourse
to his evening meal. It was contained in
a confectioner’s paper, and consisted of a large
Bath bun, embellished with currants. He plucked
out the currants carefully, and laid them apart as
dessert. After half an hour’s deliberate munching
a little of the well-being of the nourished man
returned.</p>

<p>He opened a drawer in the table, and took out
a handful of foolscap pages covered with writing
in a small and not very visible hand. These were
but a few among some two thousand others, which
embodied “A Note towards an Essay on Optimism,”
the fruit of the leisure of six years. It had
had the honor of being rejected, promptly and uncompromisingly,
by the publishers of London. Only
one among this autocracy had condescended to
supply a reason. It was brief but ample: “Philosophy
does not pay.”</p>

<p>As Northcote held these pages beneath the uncertain
rays of the lamp, and for the thousand and
first time their quality was revealed to his gaze, a
profound excitement spread through his being.
What had the degradation of his poverty enabled
him to compass for mankind? These magic pages
were so quick with authenticity that he was forced
to regard them as the gage of one who was about
to offer a universal sanction to the human heart.</p>

<p>After awhile he returned these papers to the
drawer and addressed himself to one of the dusty
manuals of jurisprudence that adorned his table.
But strange shapes were in his mind to-night; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
these would not be harnessed to the dead letter of
the law. A torrent had been unloosed which bore
his thoughts in every direction save that in which
he would have them go. After a time the lamp
burned so low that it was no longer necessary to
make a pretence at reading. Therefore he closed
the book and lifted up his ears to the night. The
faint, consistent drip drip of the water from the
ceiling to the pool it had formed on the floor stole
upon him with a sense of the uncanny. The room
itself was draughty and decrepit, and in common
with others in that neighborhood, particularly on
the waterside, was inhabited by rats. He could
hear them now in the crevices behind the wainscot.
He took from the table a piece of lead which he
used as a paper-weight, and waited grimly for one
to appear.</p>

<p>Crouching upon the hearth with this deadly instrument
in his hand, his thoughts strayed again
to the country, again to his mother, and from her
to the young girl whom he had hoped to make his
wife. This slender and straight and joyous creature,
with the supple limbs of a fawn and complexion
of a dairymaid, had the seemliness and
purity which was so essential in one who would
be called to the function of completing his life.
She was as sweet and choice as a lily, for her only
gift was the serenity which has its seat in superb
physical health and freedom from the penalties
that wait upon intelligence.</p>

<p>She had seen nothing, knew nothing; there was
nothing for her to see or to know. Her simplicity
was so naïve that it was a perennial delight to
a sophisticated nature. He never summoned her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
image except to cherish it. In his direst mood,
in his straitest hour, when life blew barb after
barb into his skin, he felt that to possess her was
to keep a talisman in his spirit which could unweave
the knots in the conspiracies of fate. Those
lines in her shape, those curves which were so
arch, so free, yet qualified so finely, seemed to
bring healing and refinement to him; while those
eyes, soft and luminous, yet lacking in expression,
seemed to chasten his power without impairing it.</p>

<p>At this moment a sound for which he had been
listening broke his reverie. An enormous she-rat,
heavy with young, entered the room. He watched
it waddle out of a dark corner and emerge slowly
towards him along the floor. As it came near he
could discern the gleam of its red eyes, its nose,
its wide-spreading whiskers. They filled him with
an indescribable ferocity. He poised the piece of
lead in his hand, and took aim with close-breathing
and deliberate care. Suddenly he hurled it with
the strength of a giant, the creature was struck
in the flank and lay dead before it knew that anything
had occurred.</p>

<p>With a grunt of satisfaction amounting almost
to joy he picked up the animal by the tail. “What
a beauty!” he muttered, “and what a shot! I
might try that a thousand times and not bring it
off.” He opened the window, flung out the carcass,
and heard it drop in a puddle of water in the
middle of the traffic.</p>

<p>The perfectly successful accomplishment of this
callous feat seemed to give his senses the exhilaration
of strong wine; and the effect was heightened
by a blast of icy air which was dashed on to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
face when he opened the window. The mighty
engines of his imagination were set in motion. He
leaned out of the window and snuffed the brutal
weather; and through the fierce sleet which stung
his eyes and froze on his lips he looked down
into London with its lights, its vehicles, and its
chaos; unknowing, unheeding, and unseeing, yet
in itself magnetic and so mysterious. He felt like
an eagle who peers out of his eyrie in the cliffs in
the midst of winter to witness the fury of the sea,
dashing itself to pieces upon his paternal rocks,
and is himself assaulted by the eternal ferocity of
nature.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br>

<small>SUMMONING THE GENIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> passion of Lear when on the heath he
bares his head to the storm mounted in his veins.
Leaning far out of the window of his garret to
confront the rage of heaven, with the unbridled
insolence of his youth he called upon the elements
to wreak themselves upon him. Let them stab his
eyes with tears, let them curdle the breath upon
his lips. Nature had charged his being with that
dynamic force which makes the world vibrate, only
to withhold the master-key without whose aid his
quality could not announce itself. All—all was
furnished in the armory of the spirit. He asked
no more than one brief occasion, and clad in his
demonic power he would shake the pillars of society
with that passion which was preying now
upon his flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Such occasions were not denied to those who did
not comprehend their use. How often with scornful
eyes was he to watch in the courts of justice
mediocrity, primed with privilege and favor, misconducting
itself amid the purlieus of the law.
Every week he was affronted with the spectacle of
this hydra-headed monster toying with the life and
liberty of the subject. At the worst it was no
more than another “miscarriage of justice;” some
other unseemly wretch offered upon the altars of
incompetence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Many times of a night when alone and hungry
had he conjured up a vision of the judge calling
from the bench for a tyro to undertake the defence
of one too poor to purchase an advocate. “You,
sir—will you undertake the defence of this unfortunate
woman?” And over and over again had
he broken the silence of his room with a carefully
modulated, “It will give me great pleasure, m’lud,
it will give me great pleasure.”</p>

<p>However, no judge had made the call. How narrowly
had some old and obtuse public servant escaped
unlocking the lips of a Milton, mute and
inglorious, who sat in a shiver of hope awaiting
the summons. To be sure, no judge had known
of so strange a presence, but had one of these venerable
guardians been aware of it, in the public
interest he would still have passed him by. For
what is more contemptible than elevation of any
kind when it seeks a platform on which to declare
itself?</p>

<p>Suppose the call came to-night! The suggestion
was conveyed in the rages of the wind buffeting
the cheeks of the unhappy man. Gasping,
drenched, and excited almost beyond the verge of
reason, he withdrew his face from the elements
and closed the window. The lamp on the table
had gone out, the few ashes in the grate gave a
mere feeble spark. In spite of the overcoat and
thick gloves which he wore, the coldness of the
room oppressed him like a sepulchre. His feet
were frozen; he had no tobacco; the clock at the
Law Courts was chiming nine. Yet suppose it
came! Why not? Why not demand it with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the fervor of his nature, like others who had sought
their opportunity had done so often?</p>

<p>He could not understand this fever which had
stretched him upon the rack. It might be that the
lack of the meanest necessaries had told too severely
upon his frame. Indeed, he was starving by
degrees. His limbs—huge, knotted things—had
withered until he was ashamed. His skin was so
pale, his cheeks so wasted, that when his eyes
flamed out in all their cadaverous lustre the prosperous
shrank from him as though he were a ghost
or a leper.</p>

<p>However, he did not covet the heritage of others.
Sharp as his belly was to-night, ragged as was
his back, he must not purchase the cuisine and
raiment of princes at the price that was asked.
Were he to inhabit the body of Crœsus, he would
have also to inhabit his soul. Throned amid pomp,
he would have dined that evening to the strains
of Beethoven under the shadows of Velasquez and
Raphael. He would have eaten the manna of the
wilderness served upon gold plate; have drunk
the fabulous Falernian, with pearls from the Orient
dissolved in it to heighten the bouquet. Gorgeous
houris, whose eyes and jewels were jealous of one
another, whose breaths were perfumed, whose lips
were laden with music, would have been on his
right hand and on his left. Yet he would neither
have seen, nor heard, nor felt, nor tasted; for
those who partook of such a feast could neither
know nor understand.</p>

<p>He must not barter his hunger for a feast such
as that. No ray of meaning ever invaded this
crapulous Barmecide. All that he saw was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the color of money was yellow; all that he knew
was that its possession oiled the wheels of life.
The starving man crouched upon his knees and
buried his burning face in the dust of the table.
He must make his apology to Nature for having
reviled her. Nothing was more imperfect than
this handmaid; yet how patient, how obedient was
this Unanswering One! She did not deserve to
be abused. For all at once, with a prophetic shudder
of his doom, he recognized that he had only
to make his demand of her to receive all that he
asked.</p>

<p>If his nature craved the material, let him seek
it and it should be given. He need not starve in
his garret; his prayers would be heard. If Success
with all her penalties must be his, let him prostrate
himself before her; was she not a courtezan
that none need to woo in vain? But crouching
thus in wretchedness, his frame shivering and burning
by turns, the price of such a triumph was
before his eyes, written in garish letters upon the
dismal walls. He was hungry to the point of death
almost, yet if he satisfied that hunger with a mess
of pottage he would be destroyed.</p>

<p>How unhappy is he who becomes the witness of
his own dread passions determining an issue on
the battle-ground of his nature! If the mere act
of volition was still to remain with him, the choice
must be made; yet if he made that which had
grown so imminent he would lose whatever status
or sanction he derived from the elevation of his
aims. This bundle of forces within him, to whom
after all he held the master-key did he but dare
to use it, was driving him pitilessly. Already he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
seemed to be losing his fineness of perception. The
point at issue was already half-erased. Those immensely
powerful engines which drove the blood
so furiously through his veins were in revolt. Let
him find employment for them; let them fulfil their
appointed ends, or woe betide him.</p>

<p>He had only to press his eyes to the table to
summon the genie. Occasion would wait upon him
if he sank to his knees. Let him harness his will
to his common needs and the power would be rendered
to him to achieve them. His imagination
had no trammels; it was burning with a volcanic
activity; by its light he could enter any kingdom
in the material world. Let him ask, and all should
be given.</p>

<p>He had fallen into a kind of trance in which immediate
sensations of place and time were suspended.
The cold room, now wrapped in an almost
complete darkness in which rats were scratching
and scuttling; the drip drip of the water to the
floor; the rattle of the windows against the rising
gale; the roar of the traffic in the street—all had
become submerged, had lost their form, had been
blended into a strange yet not inharmonious something
else. A pageant was passing before his
mind. He was powerless to identify himself with
it, to fix its colors, to catch the expressions of the
fleeting faces of those who mingled in it, yet despite
the suspension of the functions of the will,
he was conscious of what was taking place.</p>

<p>He was not in a dream, because his eyes were
open, he knew where he was, and he was in possession
of the sense of hearing. But he had surrendered
the control of the will; and although he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
on his knees with his face pressed to a dusty table
before a dead fire, the mind was become divorced
from the body and was cast into the vortex of indescribable
scenes. It drifted about among them
helplessly. It bore no relation to actors or events.
All was the weirdest panorama, crammed with
hurry and wild inconsequence; and yet the spectator
was filled with an exhilaration which was as
remote from the province of reality as a drunkard’s
delirium.</p>

<p>He began to make frantic efforts to fix and locate
this phantasmagoria. He stretched every nerve to
catch the import of the word that was spoken; he
craned his whole being to wrest a single incident
from this wild confusion. He strove as fiercely
for a thread of meaning as though he were fighting
against the operations of an anæsthetic, but
he could reclaim nothing from the chaos in which
he was enveloped. He was like a drowning man
with the heavy yet not unpleasant rush of water
in his ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mind was invaded by a distinct
sound. It had the dull sense of finality of a blow
on the head. The door of the room had been
flung open. And then came a voice through the
shadows which encompassed the last feeble gutterings
of the lamp:</p>

<p>“Anybody at home?”</p>

<p>Northcote rose from his knees in a wild and
startled manner.</p>

<p>“Who—who is that?” he cried, in a hollow
tone.</p>

<p>“Is that Mr. Northcote?” said the obscure
presence which had entered the room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>

<small>ENTER MR. WHITCOMB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the second time that evening Northcote
peered through the gloom of his chamber with a
thrill of curious expectancy. The visit of the scarecrow
had been forgotten in the torments of his
passion, but the sound of his own name on the lips
of the unknown resummoned that phantom to his
mind. But in the room of one so frail was a robust
and spreading presence.</p>

<p>“To whom do I owe a welcome?” muttered
Northcote, and as he rose from his knees his words
seemed to be lost in the vibrations of his heart.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote it is,” said the round and full
tones of the invader.</p>

<p>The advocate, trembling in every limb, was conscious
of a powerful and confident grasp of the
hand. And then as his eyes encountered the outlines
of his visitor, he was seized with a pang of
disappointment, for he had looked to see something
different.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Mr. Northcote?” said
the voice—the conventional voice which had already
smote the starving man with a sense of the
intolerable.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I do not,” he said, heavily.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought Samuel Whitcomb was known
to every member of the bar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Mr. Whitcomb’s whimsical air strove to cloak a
wound to his professional feelings.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, of course, Mr. Whitcomb; of course,”
said the young man, with a deeper disappointment
fixing its talons upon him. “Of course—Mr.
Whitcomb, the solicitor,” he added, hastily, as
through the haze of the unreal which still enveloped
his amazed and stupefied senses he caught a familiar
aspect and a tone that he recalled.</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“Excuse this inhospitable darkness,” said Northcote.
“Here is a chair; and try, if you please, to
keep your patience while I put some oil in the lamp
and seek a piece of coal for the fire.”</p>

<p>“No elaborate scheme of welcome, I beg. Your
client is not a prince of the blood, but a common
lawyer.”</p>

<p>A well-fed and highly sagacious chuckle accompanied
this sally on the part of the solicitor.</p>

<p>Still in the throes of his stupefaction, Northcote
addressed himself to the oil-can and the coal-box,
that as far as the circumstances would permit a
reception might be accorded to this unexpected
guest, whose common and prosaic quality had already
jarred upon every fibre of his being. And
these preparations, diffidently conducted, kindled
again the well-fed chuckle of the solicitor; and so
ingratiating was it that it seemed to banish all
appearance of constraint by imparting an air of
equality to everything in the world.</p>

<p>The lamp flared up under the influence of the
dregs of fuel that had been added to it, and revealed
the pale and wasted features of the garret’s inhabitant.
The solicitor, with the quickness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
trained observer, pursed up his lips in a suppressed
whistle. A kind of pity softened the relentless composure
of his eyes as they beheld the haggard and
unkempt bearing of the man before them. “Poor
devil,” he muttered; “literally starving.” It was
in this succinct yet compendious manner that Mr.
Whitcomb filed for reference all facts which are
sufficiently obvious to stand as knowledge.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Northcote, suddenly, “I
was half-expecting somebody to-night.”</p>

<p>“Sitting in state to receive him, evidently,” the
solicitor muttered, as he sniffed the temperature of
the garret and glanced oddly from the fireless grate
to the gloves and overcoat that Northcote was
wearing.</p>

<p>“Dining out together, were you?”</p>

<p>“To speak the truth,” said the advocate, with an
odd laugh, “I had hardly got so far as to consider
the personage I was half-expecting in such a grossly
material aspect.”</p>

<p>“Personage, eh?” said the solicitor. “They’re
out of my line. I only have to do with persons,
quite ordinary people, who are mightily interested
in their meals.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Northcote, “I had hardly
got so far as to formulate my expected visitant in
actual terms of flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>“You deal in spooks!” said the solicitor. “A
likely pitch for them, too.” Mr. Whitcomb began
to stroke his moustache pensively, his invariable
habit when confronted by the danger of going
beyond his limit. “A creepy hole, by God!” he
said, in another of his asides, for the simplicity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
matter-of-fact of the advocate had a little discomposed
him.</p>

<p>“I was half-expecting a genie,” said the advocate.</p>

<p>“A genie!” said the solicitor, with a laugh of
embarrassment, for his surroundings oppressed
him, and his vitality was impaired by not having
yet had his dinner. “I never heard of a genie
except in the ‘Arabian Nights.’”</p>

<p>“They abound in London,” said the advocate.
“They are all about us.”</p>

<p>“You are right, I dare say,” said the solicitor,
with a puzzled air. “The latest discovery of science,
is it? They have found such marvellous
things lately, even in the water we drink and the air
we breathe. But if you will just stick on your hat,
and do me the honor of eating a bite of supper,—I
have had a deplorable day, which has ended by robbing
me of my dinner,—I will talk to you of the
business that has brought me here at such an odd
sort of hour.”</p>

<p>“A bite of supper!” These magic words caused
the advocate to enfold his visitor in a melancholy
smile.</p>

<p>“Upon my soul,” said he, “you are the genie.”</p>

<p>The solicitor gave a laugh as ponderous as
Gargantua’s.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” he said; “but for the
love of heaven put on your hat and let us heed the
intimations of Nature. Perhaps if we pet her a
little she may do us well in this somewhat remarkable
affair. Come, let us away.”</p>

<p>That robustness of bearing which made half the
stock in trade of the first criminal lawyer in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
had already an effect upon the advocate. Those
luscious tones had dispelled his comatose condition.
And who should say, after all, that this was not the
genie; at least, here was the living embodiment of
success, that jovial and gigantic swaggerer. What
a smugness and sagacity were in the heavy inflections
of this prosperous man! “A fellow is not fit
to pare his own nails when he’s sharp-set, and I had
my chop at a quarter-past one,” he chuckled, as he
watched the advocate grappling with his boots.
“Now, on with your hat, and we’ll take a cab to I
know where.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” said the young man, reaching for
his hat.</p>

<p>A reaction was stealing along his veins. Already
his passionate despair had begun to cower. It
looked like wizardry that one so famous should
have been borne in person, dinnerless, at ten o’clock
at night, up flight after flight of dark stairs, to the
crazy fifth floor of that decrepit building in quest of
one so poor and so obscure.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are the genie,” said Northcote,
carrying the lamp to the door to light the distinguished
visitor to the head of the rickety stairs.
“Strike a match, sir, if you respect your neck.”</p>

<p>Northcote turned the key of his door, and Mr.
Whitcomb descended, step by step, in a gingerly
fashion.</p>

<p>“If there is the slightest fear,” said Northcote,
pressing on behind the solicitor, “of burning your
fingers with that match, I shall urge you not to
stop to examine the array of old masters that line
this perfectly damnable staircase of mine.”</p>

<p>“Is that an ‘Adoration of the Magi’ above me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
on the right?” said Mr. Whitcomb, with his jovial
air.</p>

<p>“No; only a crack in the plaster and a cobweb.
And that weird splotch to the left, which, at this
distance, might stand for ‘Hercules Wrestling with
Death for the Body of Alcestis,’ is the damp striking
through the wall.”</p>

<p>When at last they had crept down these noisome
stairways into the street, they found that the sleet
had yielded to a light, murky rain. The solicitor
summoned imperiously a passing hansom, and sent
a thrill through the heart of his starving companion
by naming for the cabman’s guidance one of the
most luxurious restaurants in the world.</p>

<small>AN ARISTOCRAT OF ARISTOCRATS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A swift</span> journey of a thousand yards in this
enchanted vehicle along slushy and dangerous
pavements into the West End, that magic region
and golden home of the marvelous, saw the bewildered
young man and his companion, a veritable
prince who had stepped out of some fairy romance,
deposited before the portals of a palace raised by a
wizard in the centre of the streets of London. A
master-stroke of malice had placed this temple of
choice and rarity in the midst of acres of disease,
penury, and polluted air. The faces of the
ghostly denizens of these regions broke through
the shadows with dumb malevolence as the solicitor
and the advocate leaped to the portico. Hardly had
they reached it when they were assailed by light
and color, glittering liveries, gorgeous women. A
stealthy and perfumed warmth had even invaded
the outer atmosphere. The starving man opened
his lips and nostrils, and flung wide all the doors
of the senses in order to drink the sheen and scents,
the hues and odors. Like a poet of the Latin races
he sought to feed upon animal sensations. Here in
these bright saloons was the reverse of the medal,
of which in his garret that evening he had dreamed.
By no more than the wave of a wand he had been
transported into the plaisances of success.</p>

<p>As he entered this domain he was enchanted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
everything,—the tread of the carpets, the hang of
the curtains, the clothes of the people, the sounds
of the music, the mien of the waiters. Ali Baba
did not illicitly enter the Cave of the Forty Robbers
with a more profound bewilderment, a sharper
curiosity.</p>

<p>Northcote followed his companion into one of the
smaller and quieter but not the less gilded and
luxurious rooms. Mr. Whitcomb, who even in his
own person did not disdain the panoply of fashion,
had the unconquerable nonchalance of bearing
which is the first credential to the public respect.</p>

<p>“I want Jools,” he said to the first waiter he met.</p>

<p>The waiter bowed low and said ingratiatingly,
“Yes, sare.” He darted away in quest of that personage
without an attempt to maintain the few
rags of dignity that attend his calling. There was,
indeed, a strain of the magician in this wonderful
Mr. Whitcomb. It would not have occurred to
Northcote to use the formula “I want Jools,” any
more than it did to Ali Baba to cry “Open Sesame!”
at the portals of the cave of the Forty
Robbers.</p>

<p>Jools was the head waiter, a man of the first
distinction, with a small imperial, the envy and
the proud despair of all the compatriots who shared
his exile in an alien country. It had the choice perfection
which art is sometimes able to superimpose
upon nature. Jools was of slight, even mean,
physique, but he had the ease of bearing which
comes of having been somebody for several generations.
He held the key to the finest cellar in
London, as his father before him had held the key
to the finest cellar of Paris, and his grandfather of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
that of Vienna. Jools was an aristocrat of aristocrats,
and one versed in the ways of his order
would almost have divined it from the amiable
humility with which he came forward to receive
one of other clay.</p>

<p>“How do, Jools?” said Northcote’s companion,
with his inimitable gift of manner. “Nasty night.
Let us have a quart of your Château Margaux.
What was that you gave me before?”</p>

<p>Jools screwed up his furtive brown eyes in deep
contemplation. “Et would be a seventy-one, sare,”
he said, rubbing softly a forefinger along his chin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it was,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
royally, “and I don’t care, so long as it is the best
you have in the place.”</p>

<p>An air of magnificence which prosperity had conferred
upon the solicitor touched a chord in the
proud soul of Jools.</p>

<p>“I haf a seventy-three, sare,” said this aristocrat,
with a not too ductile absence of condescension,
which he reserved for the society of his equals.</p>

<p>“That sounds all right,” said the solicitor.
“We still number you among the few eminent
Christians we have in London at the present time.”</p>

<p>Jools bowed and smiled softly, but an expression
of sorrow was seen to overspread his mat complexion.</p>

<p>“Ef I had known before, sare, I would haf had
it decanted.”</p>

<p>“We must all abase ourselves before the despotism
of necessity,” said the solicitor’s hollow-eyed
companion, who was already under the stimulus of
an intense anticipation. “She has reverence for
nothing. Even your Château Margaux ’73, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
no doubt is divine, must forego the rights and trappings
of its royalty.”</p>

<p>“You must forgive him, Jools,” said the solicitor,
enjoying the effect upon the waiter of these
deep tones. “He is talking prose, although, unlike
your immortal compatriot, I am afraid he knows
it.”</p>

<p>Jools summoned one of another mould to receive
the baser order of a thick soup and a cut from the
saddle, while he himself, beaming with pleasure
and shrugging his shoulders furiously, went forth
accompanied by an awe-stricken satellite personally
to select one of those royal wines, which lent a
touch of romantic grace to the exile of this artist
in a foreign country.</p>

<p>Seated on cushions in the cosiest of all imaginable
corners, with spotless lawn and bright silver
before him, the starving man enveloped his nostrils
in the delicious fumes that arose from his plate.
These aromatic vapors seemed to pervade his being
like some intoxicating hashish, or a pungent but
subtle Arabian tobacco. He toyed with the pepper
and salt, and crumbled his bread with a devouring
eagerness, which he kept in check sufficiently to
refuse at first to swallow a spoonful of the magic
food, in order that he might obtain this sense of
inebriation to the full. His companion, whose perfectly
normal and healthy hunger permitted no such
refinements as these, had already tasted and enjoyed.</p>

<p>“Excellent soup,” he said. “It’s got quite a
bouquet to it. I’m almost glad I missed my dinner.
One of these days I shall do it again.”</p>

<p>The satisfaction which in these circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
consumes the average sensual person grew so
acute, that by the time he had swallowed half of his
plateful, he cried out to the nearest waiter: “Hi!
you, Alphonse—have the goodness to tell the chef
to step this way, will you?”</p>

<p>Northcote placed the first spoonful on his tongue,
and indescribable pangs seemed to mount to his
brain. A fierce desire overpowered him. He devoured
another spoonful, and then another. Suddenly
he was overcome by a strange fury of greed.
His plate was empty, and his palate had lost its
original fineness, before he was able to impose
a check upon his passion.</p>

<p>Great, however, as his expedition had been in its
later stages, it had scarcely surpassed that of Mr.
Whitcomb, who from the first had been devouring
steadily. No sooner had that gentleman eaten his
final mouthful than he ordered both plates to be
replenished.</p>

<p>At this moment, by one of those significant coöperations
of events which form the basis of the
drama, a large, fat, frock-coated, and pomatumed
gentleman appeared, a little sheath of quiet smiles
twinkling all over his person, as though the playful
god of love was in hiding behind his ample shirt-front
and slyly tickling his bosom with feathers.</p>

<p>“Hommage, monsieur le chef, hommage!” cried
Mr. Whitcomb. “Cette consommé est délicieuse.
Vous êtes un vrai ruban bleu.”</p>

<p>The chef emitted a loud purr of satisfaction like
an unusually large Persian cat. And then by a still
more exquisite coöperation of events than that
which had already preceded this incident, who
should appear but Jools, behind whom his attendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
satellite was mincing with a warmed decanter
of wine.</p>

<p>“Two more glasses, Jools, if you please,” said
the solicitor. “Monsieur le chef and your worthy
self will honor us, I hope. The first product of
your country will not prove unworthy of two of its
most distinguished sons.”</p>

<p>A look of rapture sprang to the proud eyes of
Jools, and he measured four glasses of wine with an
agitation that was more dignified than perfect composure.</p>

<p>“To l’Entente Cordiale, messieurs,” said Mr.
Whitcomb, raising his glass.</p>

<p>“L’Entente Cordiale!” chimed the others.</p>

<p>“It is part of my religion,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
“never to encounter the artistic temperament
without rendering my homage. If we had only a
trace of it in this country to fuse and rarefy our
other manifold gifts and blessings, I believe we
should become the most perfect nation upon the
earth.”</p>

<p>“Is it not, sir, the absence of it that makes you
English so perfect?” said the chef, who had all the
alert intelligence of his race.</p>

<p>“That is not a thrust, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no. As a citizen of the world I make it
my duty never to wound the English. I respect
your country; there are seasons when I adore it.”</p>

<p>“Ees it not the land of justice, order, and liberty?”
said Jools.</p>

<p>“Justice we have for those who can afford to
pay for it,” said the solicitor; “that is to say, the
poor man is quite unable to purchase it, and even
the rich finds it costs a great deal of money. Order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
we have; it is the birthright of us all—an adumbration
of our exaggerated reverence for mud, and
stones, and bricks, and mortar. Liberty, Jools, I
regret to say, we have not. We are all base
slaves—”</p>

<p>“Of the External,” said Northcote, with a lustre
in his eyes that the wine had kindled. “There is
no slave like a Saxon. In his scheme of sense the
eye takes precedence. Even his religion is Money.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” said the chef, with much amiability,
“you English have no avarice like we have in my
native Normandy.”</p>

<p>“An Englishman’s avarice is not of the heart,
but of the spirit,” said Northcote, with the melancholy
calmness of one who knows everything.</p>

<p>“You haf your Shakespeare, your Milton,” said
Jools.</p>

<p>“I think sometimes we could afford to exchange
them both for your Honoré Balzac,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“You would be unwise to do so,” said the chef.
“Your Shakespeare is among the first order of
mankind. He is greater than Molière; my faith!
he is as great as Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, but your Honoré Balzac
showed the bourgeoisie its every form and feature.”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said the chef, with a sly laugh; “but
you have ceased to be bourgeois in your England
nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Since when, sir?” said the young advocate,
with a flame in his eyes. “Since we have learned
the trick of calling our mean ambitions by high-sounding
names?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The solicitor filled up the glasses of Northcote
and the chef.</p>

<p>“You speak well, my friends,” he said, with his
richest chuckle; “although myself being a middle-class
Englishman, I am sorry to say your discourse
is over my head. But if it is to be my privilege to
maintain the talk upon this extremely high level,
it will cost me, Jools—”</p>

<p>“It will cost him, Jools,” interrupted Northcote,
with a truculent glance at the waiter.</p>

<p>“It will cost me, Jools,” said the solicitor, with
an imperturbable smile, “an extra quart at least
of your Château Margaux.”</p>

<p>At the moment this order fell on deaf ears, for
the lips of Jools were trembling with speech like
those of Socrates.</p>

<p>“We will give you our Honoré de Balzac, sare,”
he said, with a heavy sigh, “ef you will part wiz
your Shikspeare.”</p>

<p>“Also our Voltaire,” said the chef, with a leer
at his melancholy compatriot, “if they will part
with their Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“Your Honoré Balzac is only just coming into
his own,” said Northcote, with immense solemnity.</p>

<p>“That is to say, sir,” said the chef, “a reputation
must be established at least a hundred years
in the arts before the world can be decorated with
the radiance that proceeds from the enormous fire
it holds in its bowels.”</p>

<p>“True, monsieur,” said Northcote. “It is like
a new-born planet. It has to be allowed to cool
a little before it can assume a shape, and the wonderful
vegetation begins to appear upon it. It cannot be
approached at first; it is a mere ball of fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in the heavens, without form and without meaning
to the human eyes.”</p>

<p>“Or it ees like a young wine, sare; it must be
allowed time to mature,” said Jools.</p>

<p>“It is the worst feature, Jools,” said the solicitor,
“of this claret of yours, that it always unlocks
the door for these pleasantries. And this British
skull of mine is so packed with business, that with
our shopkeeping instinct of transacting a little of it
whenever and wherever we can, before we fall upon
the latest theories in regard to the composition of
matter, with every reluctance, I shall ask you and
your distinguished compatriot to withdraw for the
space of one hour.”</p>

<p>“Personally,” said Northcote, “I believe the
universe is not made up of matter at all.”</p>

<p>“In other words, sir,” said the chef, “matter
is—”</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, my friends,” said the solicitor;
“but with true Britannic effrontery, this
business of mine even seeks to take precedence of
the mystery of the universe.”</p>

<p>“There is no such thing as the universe,” said
Northcote, draining his glass with great decision.
“The whole of it is contained within ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Peace, peace!” said the solicitor. “We will
resume our speculations, with the permission of
our good friends, in the space of one hour.”</p>

<p>Filled with every fraternal and complacent feeling,
Jools and his distinguished compatriot bowed
smilingly, and with a profound regard for the solicitor
and the advocate, retired, in opposite directions,
to those spheres of activity in which there was none
to dispute their supremacy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br>

<small>A PROPHECY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> now,” said the solicitor, “as the decks
are clear, let me say this is a rather odd affair
which has sent me hungry about the streets of
London at an unpleasant hour.”</p>

<p>“Am I not surprisingly cool about it?” said
Northcote, with a flushed face, balancing his empty
wine-glass on the handle of a knife, “considering
that this business of yours is destined to mark the
turning-point in my career.”</p>

<p>“When a man begins to talk of his career,” said
the solicitor, “it is safe to infer that he has taken
the wrong quantity of liquor. Waiter!”</p>

<p>“Sare?”</p>

<p>“Tell Jools we want another pint of this filthy
stuff—this what-do-you-call-it?—with which he
is poisoning us. And, Alphonse, have a couple of
Welsh rarebits ready by the time we want them.”</p>

<p>The waiter withdrew, walking delicately; and
the solicitor bent across the table towards his companion
in a manner of confidential gravity.</p>

<p>“Correct me if I am wrong,” said he, “but you
have done no circuit work?”</p>

<p>“Hitherto I have not soared beyond a police-court,”
said the young man, with perfect frankness.
“And even there I have only made a public
display of my incapacity on half a dozen occasions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“A beginner one might say, yet an ambitious
one.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get the ambition from?”</p>

<p>“It is in the color of your eyes. Besides, have
you not a habit of turning your phrases?”</p>

<p>“If I did not know you to be a connoisseur in
men of promise I should not be convinced.”</p>

<p>“That’s my foible, right enough,” said the solicitor,
with a laugh. “A connoisseur in men of promise.
Samuel Whitcomb owes his own reputation to
that, and he is proud to believe that the reputations
of half a score of those who are in every way his
superiors are to be traced to that source.”</p>

<p>“Laying aside the question of superiority, all the
world knows it.”</p>

<p>“I gave Finnemore Jones his first brief,” said the
solicitor, immodestly. “I provided Cooper, Howard,
and Harrington with the opportunities that
made them famous.”</p>

<p>“And above all,” said the young advocate, measuring
with a stealthy eye the man before him, “are
you not the discoverer of Michael Tobin?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried the solicitor, as he brought his fist
upon the table with an air of unmistakable triumph,
“I was holding that back.”</p>

<p>“As the crown of your achievement?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Michael Tobin is almost here. But how
do you come to suspect it, when at present his quality
is only known to the few?”</p>

<p>“I am one of them,” said Northcote, looking his
companion imperturbably in the eyes.</p>

<p>Such a cool affirmation seemed to delight the
solicitor.</p>

<p>“Well, I should not be surprised if you were,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
he said, with a violent chuckle. “If I had not had
some such suspicion I might not have climbed up
all those dark stairs at a quarter-past ten of a winter’s
night.”</p>

<p>“Without your dinner.”</p>

<p>“Without my dinner. Why, if that fellow hasn’t
forgotten the black currant jelly. But here he comes
with his poisonous claret.”</p>

<p>“Tobin is a brilliant man,” said Northcote, poising
his glass after having replenished it. “Irish
to the bone; a real discovery; ought to go far.
But far as he ought to go and will go, there is one
name in your list that will surpass him.”</p>

<p>“That is where I cannot agree with you, my son,”
said the solicitor, with confidential and parental bonhomie,
for this subject lay at the source of his intellectual
pride. “You must know somewhat to
have found out about Tobin; but when you name
his superior you betray your youth.”</p>

<p>“I concede it is quite impossible for me to name
Tobin’s superior without betraying my youth.”</p>

<p>“Go to,” said the solicitor, with an air of indulgence
that he reserved for the young and promising.
“Don’t labor the point. It wants experience to detect
greatness in the shell. Michael Tobin will easily
be the first upon my list.”</p>

<p>“There is one who will surpass Michael Tobin,”
said the young man.</p>

<p>“Not among those I have mentioned.”</p>

<p>“True. As is usual with the prophet, you don’t
dare to affirm the authentic name.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word I can’t think who you mean!”</p>

<p>“One Henry Northcote.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>The solicitor broke forth in a suppressed shout
of laughter.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said; “you’ll do. Fill up your
glass and we’ll get to work. And I’m glad your
talent is so remarkable, because I’ve got some business
here that is likely to tax it.”</p>

<p>“It is increasingly clear to me that you are the
genie,” said the young advocate in a low voice, and
fetching a deep breath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br>

<small>THE OFFER OF A BRIEF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> solicitor drew from an inner pocket of his
coat a bundle of papers tied with red tape. He
placed them on the table at the side of his plate.</p>

<p>“At the eleventh hour,” he said, speaking coolly
and distinctly, “I am going to ask you to undertake
the defence in a trial for murder.”</p>

<p>Northcote was conscious of no more than a slight
sharp throb of the pulses as he met the shrewd, even
cunning, eyes of the man who sat opposite.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a chance for Henry Northcote,”
were his first words, uttered under the breath.</p>

<p>“The fee is not much,” said the solicitor, with
the precision of the man of affairs entering his fat
voice. “You will not be briefed at more than
twenty guineas.”</p>

<p>“To-night I think I would sell my soul for half
that sum,” said the young man, with an excited
laugh.</p>

<p>“Is not that a somewhat damaging admission
for you to make?” said the solicitor.</p>

<p>“I agree, I agree,” said the young man; “but
the truth is never discreet.”</p>

<p>“There’s no money in this case,” said the solicitor,
“and I’m afraid there is no kudos. It is one of
those disagreeable cases which are not only irreclaimably
sordid, but also as dead as mutton. In
order to obtain a small sum of money, a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of the ‘unfortunate’ class has poisoned a man with
whom she lived. She is one of those cold-blooded
persons who are born for the gallows. There is
enough evidence to hang her ten times. We shall
be forced to submit to the inevitable.”</p>

<p>“You disappoint me,” said Northcote. “I was
thinking of a real fighting case.”</p>

<p>The solicitor smiled, with a faint suggestion of
patronage.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I’m sure,” said the young
man, quickly. “Had there been any life in the case
you would not have carried it to one so obscure.
Even as it is, I ought to be grateful to you—and
I am grateful indeed—for putting it in my
way.”</p>

<p>“The circumstances of this case are somewhat
peculiar,” said the solicitor. “We are under rather
severe pressure in the matter of time. The case will
be called on the day after to-morrow at the Central
Criminal Court.”</p>

<p>“That hardly explains away your kindness
towards myself. Even at this short notice you
could have got plenty of men to have consented to
a verdict.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of it, but then it is not quite the
method of Whitcomb and Whitcomb. We like
‘Thorough’ to be our motto. If we accept a client,
we feel we owe it to ourselves to leave no stone
unturned, irrespective of position or emolument.”</p>

<p>“But I understand this case is too dead to be
fought?”</p>

<p>“Ah, we are now about to approach the first of
the ‘peculiar’ circumstances. At five o’clock this
evening Tobin himself was holding this brief, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
at that hour his bicycle had the misfortune to collide
with a motor-car, and the poor fellow now lies in
hospital with a compound fracture of the right
thigh.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“I think you and I are agreed that Tobin is without
a rival in a case of this nature.”</p>

<p>“You must forgive me if I express surprise that
Tobin should have accepted the brief.”</p>

<p>“That is easily explained. Tobin is the generous-hearted
Irishman who is never weary of affirming
that Whitcomb and Whitcomb gave him his start.
He never refuses us, and I am afraid we, in the
interests of a client, trade occasionally on his good
nature.”</p>

<p>“Then the practitioners of law are sometimes
more disinterested than they seem.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, among a considerable body of
men must there not be a leaven of human nature?
And my own experience is that human nature is
so much more disinterested than the young and
cynical like to consider it.”</p>

<p>“That is well said,” replied Northcote, feeling
the rebuke to be merited.</p>

<p>“And so you see,” said the solicitor, “in regard
to this wretched woman whom we had undertaken
to defend, we were in the position of being able
to brief a first-rate man for a third-rate fee.”</p>

<p>“Yet a third-rate man would have served your
purpose equally well, if one is allowed to hazard
the remark.”</p>

<p>“No; for this reason: the woman has long been
of intemperate habits. Prior to the commission of
the crime she was known to be drinking heavily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and Tobin, who is a real fighting man, if ever there
was one, had decided to take the line of insanity.”</p>

<p>“As the only possible means of saving her neck?”</p>

<p>“There is no other. And even in the hands of
such a man as Tobin, the chance is remote. He
has his witnesses to call, of course, in support of
his plea, but they cannot be considered as entirely
satisfactory. And, unfortunately, their evidence
will be rebutted by that of the prison doctors, who
are against us.”</p>

<p>“Then, after all,” said the young man, with a
sunken eagerness appearing in his eyes, “there will
be opportunities for advocacy.”</p>

<p>“Pretty considerable opportunities, if we are to
save her neck.”</p>

<p>“Then forgive me if again I put the question,
Why did you come to a tyro with a case of this
nature?”</p>

<p>“How can you ask,” said the solicitor, with an
arch smile, “when the tyro happens to be one Henry
Northcote?”</p>

<p>“Upon your own admission that is a name that
has no particular significance for you.”</p>

<p>“Nay, you go too fast, my friend. It must be
left to the future to place the name of Henry Northcote,
but let me confess that in the meantime the
bearer of it has not wholly escaped my vigilance.”</p>

<p>“In your capacity as a connoisseur in young men
of promise?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Upon what data have you built, when you have
never seen him in open court?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you are as curious as a
woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Every comprehensive mind is partly feminine.”</p>

<p>“No mind can be in any sense feminine. It is
a contradiction in terms.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! From what data have you derived
the courage to entrust an untried man with the defence
in a trial for murder?”</p>

<p>“To be perfectly frank, it was Tobin who found
the courage for me.”</p>

<p>“Tobin!”</p>

<p>“No less.”</p>

<p>“Why, Tobin doesn’t know me from Adam.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my friend; don’t come to conclusions
so abruptly. Tobin has his eyes about him.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, that is an attribute that is common
to all who become first-rate in anything.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you exactly what occurred. I was
on the point of leaving Chancery Lane about six,
and beginning to think about my dinner, when I
received poor Tobin’s telegram to say he was tucked
up in hospital with a broken thigh, and would I
come to him at once. Of course I went; and there
the poor fellow was in a devilish uncomfortable
attitude, as white as the sheets, face drawn with
pain, but himself as cool as ice.</p>

<p>“‘We shall have to apply for a postponement,’
were his first words.</p>

<p>“‘In any case, old boy,’ said I, ‘I shall relieve
you of further responsibility.’</p>

<p>“‘Not much!’ said he. ‘Get a postponement
until next sessions; I am going to save the poor
beggar’s neck.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, old boy,’ I said, fixing him up with a
cigarette, ‘you will be lying here in your little bed
until next sessions.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“‘Not for me,’ he said; ‘not for Michael. I shall
be in court on two sticks a-saving the poor beggar’s
neck.’</p>

<p>“‘Now, look here, old son,’ said I, ‘just let the
whole thing go, and we’ll put up somebody else.’</p>

<p>“‘If you do,’ said he, ‘as sure as a gun she’s a
gonner.’</p>

<p>“‘I am afraid I agree,’ said I; ‘but if our fair
client is not a fit subject for the rope, upon my soul
there’s no need to hang anybody.’</p>

<p>“Well, the next thing I saw was that his eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, damn it all!’ he said, ‘I can’t stand this
hanging of women.’</p>

<p>“‘She’s an out-and-outer,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘That doesn’t alter her sex,’ said the Irishman.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘who can you suggest to put up
in your stead with your plea of insanity? The difficulty
is the brief is only marked twenty guineas,
and you can’t get much for that money with you
fellows.’</p>

<p>“‘You can’t,’ said he; ‘besides, this is a case
for Michael. Unless it is handled in a certain way
she is certain to hang. Apply for a postponement.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, you old sentimentalist, I don’t think we
could get one,’ said I, having pretty well made up
my mind that we could not.</p>

<p>“‘Who is the judge?’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Bow-wow Brudenell,’ said I, ‘the most pedantic
and cantankerous old man on the bench. And
Weekes is leading for the Crown. There will not
be much in the way of accommodation in that quarter.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, come, old Bow-wow is not such a bad old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sportsman,’ said the Irishman. ‘Tell him just how
it is; tell him I’m suddenly laid by the wing, and it
will be all right.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘even if we get a postponement,
we shall be none the better for it. It can’t be extended
indefinitely; and I am afraid, old boy, this
is going to be a long business of yours. I think
I shall hand the brief over to Harris.’</p>

<p>“At first I was afraid the wild Irishman was
going to jump out of his plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>“‘Harris!’ said he. ‘My aunt! I wouldn’t brief
Harris to defend a fox-terrier for worrying a tortoise-shell
kitten.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll admit,’ said I, ‘that Christopher is not a
genius, but at least he will get our unfortunate client
hanged like a Christian and a gentleman.’</p>

<p>“I spent nearly an hour arguing the point with
the poor old fellow. ‘I don’t hold with dumb animals
performing on the stage, and I don’t hold
with the hanging of women,’ he kept saying, in
that odd way of his which one doesn’t know exactly
how to take.</p>

<p>“‘Look here, old son,’ I said at last, growing
impatient, ‘this will have to be fixed up with Harris
to-night; and if I can’t get Harris, I shall get
Westby.’</p>

<p>“‘She can hand in her checks if you get either,’
said he. ‘She’ll be hanged by the neck without even
a run for her money.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, you can’t get “silk” for twenty guineas,’
said I; ‘and you can’t get a really useful
junior.’</p>

<p>“Now, here follows another of the ‘peculiar’
circumstances. Suddenly the wild Irishman lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
himself in his bed, and again there was that odd
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll tell you who you <i>can</i> get,’ said he; ‘he’s
come to me in a flash. Get that fellow Northcote.’</p>

<p>“‘Northcote?’ said I; ‘never heard of him.’</p>

<p>“‘Never mind, get him,’ said the wild Irishman.
‘He’s young, and they say he’s mad, but he might
bring us luck.’</p>

<p>“‘For a chap with as brilliant a set of brains as
are to be found in London,’ said I, ‘you do come
out with some of the oddest suggestions. How
did you come to think of this fellow Northcote,
when you won’t allow Harris and Westby to be
good enough?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘he’s one of my inspirations,’</p>

<p>“‘Inspiration my foot!’ said I. ‘I’m off to
Christopher Harris.’</p>

<p>“Well, as I was about to go, poor Tobin raised
himself again, and those queer eyes came at me
in a way I don’t like.</p>

<p>“‘Look here, Whitcomb,’ he said; ‘you were
a pal to me when I had hardly a boot to my foot,
but if you go to Harris I’ll never speak to you
again.’</p>

<p>“‘Lie down, you damned Celt, and go to sleep,’
I said, ‘and I’ll come and talk to you another day.’</p>

<p>“‘I won’t lie down until you promise to go to
Northcote at No. 3 Shepherd’s Inn.’</p>

<p>“‘King’s Bench Walk,’ I assured him, ‘will be
far better. If I can’t have a reckless fellow like
you, I mean to play for safety.’</p>

<p>“‘All the safety in the world,’ said he, ‘won’t
save the poor beggar’s neck.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s all very well,’ said I, ‘but an inexperienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
man might come a dreadful cropper in a case
of this kind. I believe myself in a moderate amount
of speculation, but not in a capital charge.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s her only chance,’ said the Irishman.</p>

<p>“‘I am afraid,’ said I, ‘her attorneys are not
willing to provide her with it at the risk of decency.’</p>

<p>“‘There’s your Saxon,’ said he. ‘Even when
they hang a woman, they insist on decency. Praise
be to the saints, we haven’t got any decency in our
dirty old island.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I; ‘but you’ve got a good deal of
superstition. Whatever put this fellow Northcote
into your wild head? I never remember to have
heard of him in court.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t care what you’ve heard of him,’ said
the Irishman, ‘this is where he gets his chance.
He’ll bring us luck.’</p>

<p>“‘Luck!’ said I. ‘A lawyer’s luck is based on
common sense and the capacity to see into the future.’</p>

<p>“‘We crack-brained Celts possess that capacity,’
said Tobin. ‘You can come and tell me on Monday
whether I’ve been wrong.’</p>

<p>“‘Is Northcote an Irishman, too?’ I asked, feeling
myself beginning to waver; and I don’t mind
confessing that I have never been able to withstand
Michael Tobin from the first hour I met him.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve only seen the man twice,’ said he; ‘but
if he doesn’t carry a drop of the Celt under his
waistcoat, Cork was not my birthplace.’</p>

<p>“‘Have you seen him in court?’</p>

<p>“‘Not I. The first time I saw him he was addressing
a few well-chosen remarks, quoting the
pagan philosophers, to a select gathering of the unemployed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
in Hyde Park. M’Murdo was with me.
“My hat,” said he, “that’s a fellow called Northcote;
he’s at the bar. A nice place for a barrister,
isn’t it?” “Personally,” said I, “I don’t care a
curse about the place, but I’d give ten years of my
life to have his voice.” There the thing was booming
like an organ, and we stayed half an hour listening
to rhetoric that might have come out of
Burke.’</p>

<p>“‘And the second time?’</p>

<p>“‘I have only the haziest recollection of the occasion.
Where it was I can’t recall, but the mob
orator was paraphrasing “Hamlet” to gain facility
of expression. But I remember thinking, “My
son, you will be bursting upon an astonished world
one of these fine afternoons, and then we shall all
be complaining about your luck for being born so
gifted.”’</p>

<p>“And so, my dear Northcote, to round up a long
story, thus it was I came to stand in your chambers,
dinnerless, at a quarter-past ten of a winter’s
night.”</p>

<p>As is not uncommon with those who possess mental
energy, the solicitor, under the stimulus of wine
and events, had an immense volubility. During
this recital the claret had circulated freely between
his companion and himself. Both their faces were
flushed, and, moreover, the emotions which had been
excited in the young advocate had filled him with
a kind of vertigo.</p>

<p>“After all,” said he, resting his forehead on his
hand and staring into vacancy, “it is most probably
Tobin who is the genie.”</p>

<p>“Set a thief to catch a thief,” laughed the solicitor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
“Michael Tobin and yourself are well
matched—a pair of deuced odd fellows.”</p>

<p>“In any case,” persisted Northcote, “if a genie
you are, you would say you are a genie in spite of
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I say nothing at all when it comes to genies,”
said the solicitor with emphasis. “I don’t know
anything about them; they are not in my line.
They don’t trouble the common lawyer in the pursuit
of his bread. What does trouble him is time,
for time is money.”</p>

<p>The solicitor took out his watch, a thing of value.</p>

<p>“Twenty past eleven,” he said. “There’s a fortune
awaiting the fellow who invents an automatic
brake to slip on old Father Time. I’ve got to get
out to Norbiton to-night,—I promised my little
girl, and she will be sitting up. But before I go
I wish you would cast your eyes over your brief,
and tell me precisely what you think about it.”</p>

<p>The solicitor handed to Northcote the document
tied with red tape, and called again for the waiter.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a liqueur?—they’ve got some
white curaçao that might be worse. And perhaps
some coffee might help us at this stage. Fortunately,
this is the one place in London where they
know how it’s made. And, Alphonse, you might
bring some of those fireworks that you call cigars.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br>

<small>EQUITY A FRUIT OF THE GODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time the waiter had returned, the young
advocate was addressing himself to the bundle of
papers with a remarkable energy. Already a fierce
mental excitement had stirred him. His senses,
overstimulated by a wine of great potency, and by
a too sudden reaction from a state of actual bodily
starvation, a fever had been kindled in his frame.
And those high ambitions which had reconciled him
to existence through so long a period of the most
abject penury, yet whose only home had been his
wild dreams, had suddenly, at the touch of the magic
wand of the enchanter, acquired a name and a local
habitation.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that to the eyes of the solicitor,
that cool, mature, and rather cynical man of the
world, this young man, in whom strong and deep
emotions had been let loose, soon became an object
of scientific interest. Mr. Whitcomb felt himself
to be even a little disconcerted by the feverish manner
in which the young advocate tossed about the
pages of his brief. As he came to note the vivid
pallor of the face before him, the burning of the
eyes, the twitching of the lips, he felt a qualm of
uneasiness. Perchance it had been neither wise nor
kind to be so lavish of the Château Margaux.
Blood which had been deteriorated by a course of
insufficient food was only too likely to be over-charged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> 
by an unaccustomed accession of heat. Already
it had seemed to be waxing too high.</p>

<p>“Here is your liqueur,” said Mr. Whitcomb, with
a slight perturbation, “and here’s a cigar I’ve
chosen for you. And here’s a nice black coffee that
may steady you a bit.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks,” muttered Northcote, nodding
his head in a mechanical manner.</p>

<p>The solicitor gulped his liqueur, and cut off the
end of his cigar.</p>

<p>“Well, old boy,” he said, letting a somewhat
whimsical gaze fall upon the man who sat opposite,
“do you feel like giving us a bit of a run for our
money at the hour of ten-thirty at the Central Criminal
Court on Friday morning next, or would you
prefer that the chance should be offered to Harris?”</p>

<p>The advocate swallowed his coffee.</p>

<p>“You will have a run for your money all right,”
said he, “on Friday morning next. Upon my soul,
I believe you have given me a start with the most
fascinating case in the world.”</p>

<p>The solicitor pursed up his lips in an expression
of genial contradiction.</p>

<p>“If you find fascination in a thing like that,”
he said, “you must look very deep. The whole
business is sordid, atrocious, bestial. The crime is
brutal and perfectly commonplace.”</p>

<p>“Is it not a mere question,” said the advocate,
“of the fashion in which one uses one’s eyes, of
the plane over which one permits them to stray?”</p>

<p>“There is only one plane, my friend,” said the
solicitor, “over which an attorney permits <i>his</i> eyes
to stray. That is the obvious diurnal one of matter-of-fact
common sense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Yet it may happen,” Northcote rejoined, “that
the plane of matter-of-fact common sense may not
be identical in the eyes of attorney and advocate.”</p>

<p>“Is not the hour somewhat advanced for a Socratic
dialogue?” said the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Also,” persisted Northcote, “the plane of matter-of-fact
common sense, in whatever it may consist,
may not prove identical in the eyes of the jury
and the judge; also in the eyes of the person who
committed the crime, and the person who was the
victim of it.”</p>

<p>“We are not here to traverse the moral code,”
said the solicitor, “or to enter the domain of abstract
reason. The English penal law is perfectly
explicit upon the point at issue, as I think you will
find on Friday.”</p>

<p>Of a sudden Northcote struck the table a violent
blow.</p>

<p>“This unhappy woman has been deeply wronged
by circumstance,” he said, with a vehemence that
was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>“It will do your case no harm to show that to
the jury,” said the solicitor, sucking quietly at his
cigar. “There is not a scrap of evidence to support
such a contention, but it might be of service
if it could be upheld.”</p>

<p>“Is it not here that we enter on the higher function
of the advocate’s art?” said the young man.
“Does it not consist in the evocation of that which
lies outside the obvious?”</p>

<p>“You must have it entirely your own way, my
dear fellow,” said the solicitor warily. “I don’t
propose to play the rôle of Adeimantus at this hour
of the night. But I don’t mind remarking that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
will have to evoke that which is very far outside
the obvious to secure the acquittal of my client on
Friday.”</p>

<p>“That is viewing the subject from the plane of
matter-of-fact common sense which you are content
to inhabit?”</p>

<p>“That is so; I can view it from no other. But
may I remark in parenthesis that you are also likely
to find the judge and jury inhabiting that plane on
Friday.”</p>

<p>“You permit yourself a greater definiteness than
I dare to employ,” said Northcote. “But the point
I would like to fix is this: Assuming that I am able
to evoke that which in your view lies so far outside
the obvious as to be non-existent, will you countenance
my so doing in the prisoner’s interest?”</p>

<p>The solicitor gave a short nervous jerk to his
mustache.</p>

<p>“That is a rather extraordinary proposition to
advance,” he said disconcertedly; “and as you
are a young man, a beginner, perhaps you will forgive
my saying that I consider you hardly wise to
advance it.”</p>

<p>“Because we cannot contrive to keep our corns
out of the way, eh? We would look upon equity
as a sort of fruit of the gods, which mankind may
eat of, but may not analyze.”</p>

<p>“I shall not attempt to follow you. But what
I would like to say is this,—and I hope, my dear
fellow, you, as an advocate, will not consider this
as a breach of etiquette on the part of your client,—I
don’t like your question at all. In a word,
speaking with twenty years’ experience behind me,
I hardly think it ought to have been put.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>The accession of somewhat strenuous solemnity
to a manner which a minute ago had been grossly,
carelessly genial, filled Northcote with a heavy
mocking laughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it at all; oughtn’t to have been
put,” Mr. Whitcomb reaffirmed, with a curious
admixture of nervousness and sternness.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I shall ever acquire the most valuable
of all the arts,” said the young man, with
an arch smile; “the art of knowing where not to
look.”</p>

<p>“That art comprises the first law of success,”
said the solicitor sententiously.</p>

<p>“I omitted to append a rather important corollary
to that extraordinary proposition of mine,” said
Northcote, with a mischievous air. “It is this:
Is the advocate entitled to evoke what is non-existent
in the eyes of his client, providing it has an
existence in his own?”</p>

<p>“I hope to be spared anything further upon the
subject,” said the solicitor. “I don’t aspire to be
a casuist; I’m a common lawyer. But I feel I am
entitled to say this: use this subtlety of yours on
Friday to a full advantage, and you will have no
cause to regret having done so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the voice of the genie, right enough,”
said the young man, in a hollow voice, as he toyed
with an empty wine-glass.</p>

<p>“And I feel I am also entitled to say,” said
the solicitor, with emphasis, “since your mind appears
to be exercised by the question, that when
an advocate accepts a brief, his whole duty is to
his client.”</p>

<p>“And in the case of this unfortunate woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
will serve the interests of his client by securing her
acquittal?”</p>

<p>“Unquestionably.”</p>

<p>“If the ends of justice are thereby defeated?”</p>

<p>“Well, since you force one to say it, the interests
of the prisoner’s attorney may not always be
coincident with those of justice.”</p>

<p>“My dear Adeimantus, that is well said,” the
young man exclaimed. “Yet I have your assurance
that the interests of client and advocate should
be always identical?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you are entitled to say that,” said
the solicitor; “although understand, if you please,
I speak entirely in my capacity as an attorney.”</p>

<p>“From which I gather that as a unit of mankind,
as a subscriber to the common equity, you reserve
to yourself the right to appease your private gods
subsequently in your own private fashion?”</p>

<p>“I suppose one does.”</p>

<p>“And in the meantime, you and I, attorney and
advocate, must compass the liberation of this foul
murderess, must, if we can, give her back to society?”</p>

<p>“Personally, I shall be content if we enable her
to escape the extreme penalty.”</p>

<p>“You balk my question.”</p>

<p>“Pray have it as you choose. Thank God, I am
only a common lawyer!”</p>

<p>“My dear Samuel Whitcomb,” said the young
man, peering at him with gaunt eyes, “you would
do well to get down here and now on your knees,
and thank Him for a dispensation of that kind.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br>

<small>THE BRIEF WITHDRAWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Waiter!</span>” called the solicitor at this point.
“More coffee, if you please. Let it be hot and
strong.” Turning to Northcote, he added: “Our
minds have grown so subtle with that claret we’ve
got to find out where we are.”</p>

<p>“Narcotics are not usually the friends of truth,”
said his companion.</p>

<p>“My worthy Samuel Taylor,” laughed the
solicitor, “I hope you will not forget I want to
get to Norbiton to-night.”</p>

<p>“There is one other point,” said the young
man imperturbably, “on which I wish to render
myself clear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb permitted himself a shrug of unmistakable
expostulation.</p>

<p>“What, another!” he muttered under his breath.
“This fellow is the devil!”</p>

<p>“I do not propose to take the line of insanity.”</p>

<p>Northcote spoke with a quietness which seemed
to deepen the reverberation of Mr. Whitcomb’s
subsequent exclamation.</p>

<p>“Then you hang her!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Northcote, “I promise
an acquittal.”</p>

<p>For a moment the solicitor was robbed of speech
by this extraordinary announcement.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” he exclaimed, with a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
manifest impatience than any he had yet shown,
“you can hardly have read your brief. There is
nothing to extenuate the crime; and the evidence
of it is overwhelming.”</p>

<p>“Circumstantial, apparently.”</p>

<p>“You must know that in a capital charge the
prosecution relies almost invariably upon circumstantial
evidence.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for it in this particular instance.”</p>

<p>“I am at a loss to understand.” The solicitor
spoke in accents of alarm. “There is not a man
living who could overthrow the present evidence.”</p>

<p>The young man smiled darkly. The symptoms
of his inebriation had yielded to the clarifying influence
of a liqueur and two cups of strong black
coffee. His calmness was now forming a memorable
contrast to the marked excitement of the
older man.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Whitcomb,” he said, “I suggest,
as you wish to get to Norbiton, that we adjourn
this discussion until Friday evening, by which time
Emma Harrison, <i>alias</i> Cox, <i>alias</i> Marshall, will be
restored to society.”</p>

<p>“Such an undertaking is entirely reckless,” said
the solicitor bluntly. “Quite the last thing that
Tobin himself would attempt would be to upset the
theory of the prosecution. The chain of evidence
could not be more complete. Even he, in the opinion
of many the most brilliant common law man
we have at the present moment at the bar, would
be content to urge extenuating circumstances, and
call witnesses in their support.”</p>

<p>“Since you have seen fit to entrust the conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of this case to me,” said Northcote, “I shall beg
to be conceded as free a hand as would have been
conceded to Michael Tobin.”</p>

<p>“Is your request quite reasonable?” said the
solicitor. “Tobin has years of experience and success
behind him.”</p>

<p>“You can trust me not to attempt more than I
can perform,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“Really, sir,” said Mr. Whitcomb, genuinely
alarmed by such an obduracy, “I cannot admit your
right, in the circumstances in which you stand at
present, to overstep the bounds that are so clearly
indicated by persons of experience.”</p>

<p>“I take this brief into court free of all restriction,”
was the young man’s rejoinder.</p>

<p>“That one can hardly consent to,” said the solicitor.
“Would you say it is quite legitimate to make
such a stipulation? We have our witnesses on the
line of insanity, and we must ask to have them
called.”</p>

<p>“But do you not see,” said Northcote, “that if
we call those witnesses we admit the theory of the
prosecution, and cut the ground from under our
own feet?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly. One would have thought
that so much would be self-evident.”</p>

<p>“Yet you sought me out in the capacity of a
fighter. I take it that had you not desired to fight
you would have gone straightway to Harris.”</p>

<p>“I can only admit the possibilities of a fight
within limits. The woman’s guilt is established beyond
question; our only concern is to mitigate its
degree.”</p>

<p>“For my own part,” said the advocate, “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
not prepared to accept your proposition. To my
mind, so far is the woman’s guilt from being already
established, that I am prepared to give an
undertaking that it never will be established.”</p>

<p>The solicitor drummed his fingers on the table-cloth.</p>

<p>“I should like Tobin to hear you say that. I
wish you had been at the police-court when the
case came before the magistrate. There is enough
evidence to hang an archdeacon.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. But we shall be getting back to
those abstract principles for entertaining which I
have already suffered reproof.”</p>

<p>The solicitor gave an uneasy eye to his watch.</p>

<p>“You force me to deliver an ultimatum,” said
he, in an uncompromising tone. “Please have the
goodness to give an undertaking to conduct the defence
on the lines indicated by Tobin, or return the
brief.”</p>

<p>A wave of blood surged through the brain of the
young advocate. A dismal sickness overspread his
veins. Tantalus was about to pluck away that which
he had fasted and prayed for before he could take
it in his grasp.</p>

<p>“You have entrusted it to me already,” he said,
in a dull, dry voice.</p>

<p>“In a case of this magnitude,” said the solicitor,
with an almost brutal precision, “I reserve to myself
the right to alter my mind. You have forced me
to issue an ultimatum. Accept or reject it, whichever
you choose.”</p>

<p>The solicitor called for his bill in a hectoring
manner, and threw a bank-note on the waiter’s
salver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>The young advocate, in the meantime, buttoned
the brief in the breast-pocket of his somewhat
threadbare black coat.</p>

<p>“What is your decision?” said the solicitor, regarding
the young man with an insolent coolness.</p>

<p>“You can’t have back your brief,” said Northcote.
“You gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“It can only be held conditionally,” said Mr.
Whitcomb, “and the conditions are perfectly easy
to accept.”</p>

<p>“The brief was delivered unconditionally into
my keeping,” said Northcote, in an arid voice.
“And,” he added, with a sudden gleam of the eyes
as an overpowering recollection of his destiny came
back to him, “you will have no reason to regret
your act.”</p>

<p>Before the solicitor had framed a reply the waiter
had returned with the receipted bill.</p>

<p>“Keep the change,” said the solicitor, “and call
a hansom.”</p>

<p>The waiter withdrew.</p>

<p>“Do I take it,” said the solicitor, with an incisive
drawl in his speech as he turned to Northcote,
“that you have said no?”</p>

<p>“I have said no in the first place to your restrictions,”
said Northcote, looking him full in the eyes,
“and in the second to your ultimatum.”</p>

<p>“Then with all possible reluctance I must ask
you to have the goodness to return the brief.”</p>

<p>“With an equal reluctance I feel I must decline
to do so,” said Northcote, speaking through tight
lips.</p>

<p>For a moment the solicitor was taken aback by
this pointblank refusal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“But—but—” he stammered, “surely this is
most unprofessional. Such a thing has never happened
to me in all my twenty years of practice.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t suppose,” rejoined the young advocate,
“it will ever happen to you again. But suppose
we leave the plane of our professionalism, step
down from our platform, and approach the prejudices
of each other in a rational spirit.”</p>

<p>“No more argument, I beseech you,” said the
solicitor sternly; “I’ve got to get to Norbiton.
Return the brief, and we will say no more. You
are not the man for this case. You have a bee in
your bonnet; you have too many brains. I think
none the worse of you, mind; I respect you; you
have your ideas; one day they may prove valuable,
but not in common law. You have mistaken your
<i>métier</i>, that is all. We will say you are above your
work; at any rate, with all deference to Michael
Tobin, I shall prefer to see Harris holding briefs
of ours before a common-sense English jury and
a matter-of-fact English judge when it comes to the
capital charge.”</p>

<p>“If you are present in court on Friday,” said
Northcote, “you will find that I, not Harris, will
still be holding the brief you entrusted to my care.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” muttered the solicitor to himself,
“this fellow is a madman, a lunatic. I dare
say he’s been starving so long that a square meal
has turned his brain.”</p>

<p>Involuntarily his eyes began to traverse the face
of the man who sat bolt upright with arms folded
at the other side of the table. It was excessively
pale, flushed with wine and conversation, and
strangely, exquisitely mobile. It had a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
gaunt delicacy, but the obvious traces of suffering
were permeated by a remarkable power. The features
were irregular yet not unpleasing, the nose
was straight and incisive, the eyes deep and luminous,
the mouth large and full-lipped. The general
expression was sombre, because it was so bluntly
dominating, yet it was rendered memorable by many
subtle qualities. Clearly it was one of those faces
which to see was never to forget.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb, in spite of his desire to get to
Norbiton, and the severe tests to which his constitutional
arrogance as an immensely successful
man of the world had been subjected, owed too
much to his trained powers of observation to lay
them aside at a moment so remarkable.</p>

<p>“This fellow is cut to a big pattern,” was his
mental comment. “That is a splendid mask for an
advocate. Upon my soul, if he were not so mad I
think I should be inclined to back him heavily. Yet
I believe he is literally starving.”</p>

<p>The solicitor rose abruptly from the table to dispel
his reverie.</p>

<p>“Rather than you should feel you have ground
for complaint,” said he abruptly, as if touched by
compassion, “I shall ask you to allow me to advance
half of your fee; and to-morrow I will send you
some other sort of work.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb unrolled a note for ten pounds
and gave it to Northcote.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “kindly return the brief and
I will go.”</p>

<p>Northcote crumpled up the note and thrust it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“I accept half my fee,” said he, “not as a bribe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
but as a retainer. By this means I pledge myself
to conduct the case to its appointed issue.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not let us misunderstand one another,”
said the solicitor, with a sense of being trapped.
“This brief is withdrawn definitely; I ask you to
return it to me. I give you ten pounds as a solatium
for losing your fee.”</p>

<p>“I cannot construe the situation in that fashion,”
said the young man calmly.</p>

<p>“This is not a question of construction,” said
the solicitor, with his anger beginning to announce
itself; “it is a question of hard fact. Your brief
is withdrawn.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Northcote, with expansive bluntness,
“do not submit to its withdrawal.”</p>

<p>Before this <i>impasse</i> which had presented itself in
a manner so definite, the solicitor, whose patience
had been strained beyond the breaking-point, could
only take refuge in a series of imprecations.</p>

<p>“Fellow’s drunk,” he muttered. “Shall have to
see him first thing to-morrow. But it is most irritating
that he should refuse to give up the papers
when time is so short. It looks like an application
for a postponement after all.”</p>

<p>The solicitor turned for the last time to the advocate.</p>

<p>“It is a quarter-past twelve,” he said brusquely,
“and I am going home. And I would like to urge
you to gain reflection by the aid of a few hours’
sleep, because I shall look for that brief to be delivered
at my offices at a quarter-past ten to-morrow
morning. Good night.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand; Northcote ignored it.</p>

<p>“You appear to impugn my sobriety,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
latter, “and that is a pity, because in all my life
I have never felt my mind to be quite so clear as
it is to-night. Perhaps it is not fair to expect you
to appreciate the point at which I have arrived, and
why it is impossible for me to restore your brief.”
He pressed his hands over the bundle of papers in
his coat. “You see your brief is my destiny.”</p>

<p>A final expression of somewhat forcible disapproval
escaped Mr. Whitcomb, and he moved away
to the room in which he had deposited his hat and
coat.</p>

<p>As an attendant was assisting to envelop the solicitor’s
portliness in these articles, it annoyed him
to find that Northcote had followed him.</p>

<p>“Why not spare one this trouble to which you
are putting one?” he said reproachfully. “Why
not be moderately reasonable about it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, you see,” said Northcote with a smile, as
he presented the ticket for his own extremely time-worn
hat and coat, “even a thing so primitive as
‘the moderately reasonable’ must submit itself to
the peculiarly elusive mental plane one is doomed
to inhabit.”</p>

<p>“Peace! peace!” said the solicitor. “No more
of that!”</p>

<p>“Attorney and advocate, judge and jury,” said
the young man, as he rummaged in vain among
his pockets to find a tip for the attendant, “justice
and equity, the prisoner at the bar and the victim
of circumstance,—one and all are to be poised
upon the same arbitrary moral elevation, to submit
to the mandates of a tribunal which is the creation
of that egregiously warped and time-serving thing
upon which we bestow the name of The Majority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Peace! peace!” said the solicitor, unable in
spite of himself to repress a laugh at the amazed
face of the cloak-room attendant, and moving to
where his hansom awaited him; “give up those
papers here and now like a good fellow, and save
me a great deal of time and worry. If Harris
doesn’t see them first thing to-morrow it means a
postponement, and we don’t want that.”</p>

<p>“There is need for neither,” said Northcote, buttoning up
his threadbare overcoat. “But, ye gods
and little fishes! what is the name for the total
blindness, the pathetic obtuseness, which has eclipsed
the faculties of this connoisseur, this expert? Here
is one who has been angling for years for a real
authentic fish from the sea, yet when one plumps
into his net, being accustomed to nothing but the
sight of minnows, he doesn’t even guess at his
travaille.”</p>

<p>By this time the solicitor had fled precipitately
through the vestibule of the restaurant, and stood
in the portico awaiting his hansom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br>

<small>THE RIDE TO NORBITON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> he was entering the vehicle Northcote came
to his side.</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Mr. Whitcomb. “In the
morning, perhaps, when you see things a bit clearer
you will think better of this. In fact I am sure
of it; and I hope you will not forget to send round
the brief.”</p>

<p>Before he could close the door of the hansom,
the young man had joined him in its interior.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind my coming with you,”
he said, entirely at his ease. “This matter is far
too momentous for all concerned to be left in the
unsatisfactory stage at which it has now arrived.”</p>

<p>“This fellow is the devil,” muttered the solicitor,
suppressing a groan.</p>

<p>“Where, sir?” said the cabman through the hole
in the roof.</p>

<p>“Norbiton.”</p>

<p>“Norbiton! Not to-night, sir; the ’oss is tired.”</p>

<p>“Take me to Norbiton,” said the solicitor sharply,
“and never mind about your horse.”</p>

<p>“Very sorry, guv’nor—”</p>

<p>“Well, if you can afford to lose a sovereign—”</p>

<p>The cabman’s head disappeared immediately, and
the horse started on its journey at a good round
pace.</p>

<p>“These cabmen are the greatest robbers in Europe,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
said the solicitor, settling himself in his corner.
“They are a disgrace to London. One would
like to see them taken over by the state.”</p>

<p>Although Mr. Whitcomb was ruffled by his companion’s
strange pertinacity, his philosophic habit
soon came to his aid.</p>

<p>“Have a weed?” he said, offering his cigar-case.</p>

<p>By the time each had lighted a cigar and ensconced
himself in a measure of comfort in a corner
of the vehicle, the irritation of the one and the
aggressive tenacity of the other had been somewhat
allayed.</p>

<p>“There are several points that still remain dark
to me,” said Northcote, “in this odd affair. Having
come in a moment of high inspiration to the
attic of the obscure, having discovered its occupant
to be of an uncommon faculty, having entrusted
him with your business, all of a sudden, because
of a singular revelation of his talent, you discard
him and have recourse to an abject mediocrity.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly a queer fellow,” said the
solicitor, amused by this piece of egotism. “A
most unconventional fellow—quite the most unconventional
fellow I have ever met.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there is my offence,” said the young man;
“I have outraged the gods, I have disregarded the
proprieties. Yet I would ask you, are not all conventions
for the common vulgar? Are not nature’s
most authentic specimens, those pioneers in every
sphere of mundane activity who add the little more
that means so much, are not these to walk about the
earth just as nature fashioned them?”</p>

<p>“I am pleased to say,” said Mr. Whitcomb, emitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
a soft purr of contentment, “I am a common
lawyer. The whys and wherefores are not my
province; I take things as they are.”</p>

<p>“That does not prevent all your instincts being
up in arms when you encounter the unusual. How
curious it is that the most deadly sin in the eyes
of the average person is that shameless egotism
which transacts the real business of the world.”</p>

<p>“If there were no rules to which one had to
conform,” said the solicitor, “there would be no
living in the world. Conventions to my mind are
highly necessary. Of course every man has a perfect
right to consider himself a tremendous fellow,
but that is no reason why he should say as much
to his neighbor. If he does, his neighbor will want
to refute it.”</p>

<p>“And if he should throw down his gage, and
prove to his neighbor in a perfectly logical and
scientific manner that he is a tremendous fellow,
his neighbor will not be content with wanting to
refute him; his neighbor will want to shoot him,
or hang him, or burn him, or crucify him, and it
is long odds that his neighbor will succeed in so
doing.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I don’t follow you.”</p>

<p>“I am speaking of the fate that awaited upon
the majority of the tremendous fellows whom we
discover in the pages of history; the founders of
the religions, the saints, the heroes, the discoverers,
the makers of the philosophical systems.”</p>

<p>“One suspects,” said the solicitor, “it was because
they made the world so uncomfortable while
they were living in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I agree. But what a world we should have if
they had not.”</p>

<p>“It is not at all clear to my mind,” said the
solicitor, “that in the long run these fellows of
whom you are speaking have not done more harm
to the world than they have done good. Not only
did their abnormal egotisms run am k during their
own lives, but after their deaths, which as you suggest
were often brutal and unnecessary, they continued
in the guise of saints and martyrs, and inspired
teachers to wreak iconoclasm and discomfort upon
mankind.”</p>

<p>“One can readily believe,” said the young man,
“that you, sir, in your capacity of a member of the
comfortable classes, to which by fortune and education
you belong, would fetter the march of ideas
by every means in your power.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the solicitor, drawing peacefully at
his cigar; “few things are more distasteful to me
personally than ideas. Particularly those lawless
ones which proceed from ill-regulated and ill-balanced
natures. It seems to me that they are responsible
for nine-tenths of the misery that is in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Do I take it that, in your opinion, so far from
these so-called ‘great men’ of whom we are speaking
meriting esteem from their fellows, their doctrines
as well as their persons should be pursued
with the fire and the sword; and that means should
be adopted to exterminate the growth of these
‘great’ ones from the comfortable republic which
is inhabited by the average person?”</p>

<p>“I would suggest it. I have given little thought
to this subject, but I cannot think of a single historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
personage of whom I do not consider that
in the long run mankind would have gained immeasurably
had he never been born into its midst.”</p>

<p>“This is extreme doctrine,” said Northcote;
“and may I pay you the compliment, sir, of saying
that I find you to be one of a greater courage than
I had suspected.”</p>

<p>“All the so-called ‘greatness’ one finds enshrined
in history,” the solicitor continued, “proceeds
from an abnormal egotism; and I think even
a perfectly commonplace mind such as my own,
which is content with the obvious, has only to take
a most superficial look around to see that the abnormal
is the only evil against which mankind has
to contend.”</p>

<p>“Necessarily,” said Northcote, “since the self-consciousness
of matter is the ugliest phenomenon
known to natural law. But to follow the line of
your reasoning, the abnormal person, whatever the
sphere of his activity, is invariably the enemy of
his kind?”</p>

<p>“That is my suggestion; the suggestion of an
average mind that is content to rest on the plane
of matter-of-fact common sense.”</p>

<p>“You would say that it would have been better
for mankind had the poet Shakespeare never been
given to it?”</p>

<p>“Unquestionably. In my view, all poetry, even
in what we are pleased to call a sublime and concentrated
form, is a direct emanation of morbid
sensibility. It stimulates those already sufficiently
irritable faculties of the mind which call for a
never-ceasing vigilance to hold in check. Poetry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
is the chief enemy against which rational common
sense has to contend.”</p>

<p>“Then in your view the greatest enemy of the
human race of which history has taken cognizance
is Jesus Christ?”</p>

<p>“I will not say the greatest; but He shares the
opprobrium that attaches to His class. It was that
type of abnormalism which developed the religious
sense in man; and any sense more calculated to
provoke infinite misery, any sense more completely
out of harmony with the facts of existence, one cannot
conceive.”</p>

<p>“In a word, excess of any kind is repugnant to
the average person?”</p>

<p>“One would say so; mainly, I think, because
it extorts such heavy toll of all who are brought
in contact with it.”</p>

<p>“Then elevation of feeling, profundity of
thought, subtlety of insight, austerity of morals,
heroism, beauty, in short, the superlative in any
guise whatever, should be eliminated from the republic
of the average sensual person?”</p>

<p>“If the average sensual person could contrive
a republic for himself, that would be its first decree.”</p>

<p>“Hence his hostility to those abnormal egotisms
which are known as ‘greatness’?”</p>

<p>“As far as the average person can see, that appears
to go down to the root of the matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the young advocate, “permit
me to take a slight parable out of my own experience
to refute this supposition.”</p>

<p>“Pray do so.”</p>

<p>The advocate selected as a preliminary a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
cigar from the case of the solicitor, and resettled
himself in comfort in the corner of the vehicle.</p>

<p>“All my life,” said Northcote, “from the farthest
day to which my memory goes back, I have
been persecuted with the consciousness of my own
importance. In all my dealings with others, in the
daily outlook upon my surroundings, not only have
I been unable to detach myself from my own private
entity, but I have also been obsessed with the
knowledge that that entity was so much more powerful
than any with which it happened to come in
contact. As you will believe, a feeling of that kind
spelt serious inconvenience to its possessor. At my
private school I was the recipient of many cuffs
in my capacity of a shy, nervous, and intensely self-centred
child who detested games. It grew to be
a special function of my youthful companions, and
also that of every self-respecting master, to ‘knock
the nonsense out of Northcote.’ However, so far
from knocking it out, these disinterested efforts
appeared to knock it farther in. And when in the
fulness of time I ascended to the ampler region of
a public school, my sufferings were materially increased.
I was shunned, I was tormented, an opprobrious
name was fastened upon me; and had not
the fire which burned so intensely at the centre of
myself kept me warm in spirit, life would have
become intolerable.</p>

<p>“It was a consciousness of personal power haunting
me day and night which caused me to scorn
the gods of the little world in which I found myself,
and to disregard the petty conventions which mean
so much in every phase of human life. Accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
I was marked out as an object of hatred and
ridicule. However, as years went on, and I came
to be endowed with the somewhat unusual physical
frame which you may have observed I possess, I
determined in a somewhat cynical spirit of revenge
to devote myself to one of those stupid and unmeaning
exercises, my contempt for which was one
of the most potent causes of my unpopularity.
Never before had I condescended to approach one
of the usual school ‘games,’ other than in a spirit
of levity; but when I awoke to the discovery that
nature had somewhat ironically endowed me with
a power of muscle, a suppleness of limb, and a bulk
of inches which would in themselves make me the
envy of every athlete in the school, I determined to
turn them to account. It was in no spirit of open
competition with those whom I despised that I
resolved to become the most accomplished football-player
who had ever appeared in the school. It was
my somewhat curious method of avenging all the
insults, all the barbarous forms of injustice, that
had been wreaked upon me. I might have requited
my assailants in other ways, but I was too proud
to employ the methods of those whom I felt to be
my mental, physical, and moral inferiors. Therefore
I gave myself up to this mechanical exercise,
and an abnormal concentration of will-power which
I have always possessed, in conjunction with remarkable
physical gifts, had the result for which
I had prayed.</p>

<p>“When this new prowess was first bruited
abroad it was received with derision. But in spite
of an organized public opinion which in every walk
of life assails the unconventional, this ability became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
a source of distress to the expert. ‘It comes
to this,’ said the captain of the School Fifteen, after
a House cup-tie in which dismay had been carried
into the camp of the opposition, ‘if this sort of
thing goes on, we shall have to think about playing
“Cad” Northcote for the School.’ The shouts of
derision with which this prophecy was received are
still in my ears. However ‘this sort of thing’
continued to go on, and sure enough, to the amazement
of men and gods, the day dawned on which
‘Cad’ Northcote did play for the School. He
dominated the scene of action in every game in
which he took part; but such was the strength of
public opinion that the ruling powers withheld his
‘cap’ until the very last moment, the eve of the
chief game of the year. It was the match against
our great school rivals, a neighboring seminary,
of which, sir, I discern by certain unfortunate
tricks of manner that you are an alumnus.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” said the solicitor;
“get on with your story. It is enormously interesting.
Did you play against us in the great
match?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I played against you in the great match.
The ‘fez’ of the School Fifteen, which should
have been mine weeks before, was duly presented
to me on the eve of ‘Waterloo,’ for although it
was a dreadful crime to be ‘unpopular,’ it was yet
highly necessary to ‘take on’ the French. And I
recall now with some amusement the manner in
which I contrived to flout the <i>amour propre</i> of the
venerable institution into whose service I was
pressed. Instead of turning out in the garish colors
with which I had been honored at the eleventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
hour, I appeared upon the scene in a costume of
the most immaculate whiteness. As soon as the
captain beheld this apparition on the field of play,
he came to me and said insolently: ‘Northcote,
what do you mean by getting yourself up like this?
Go back at once and put on the School colors.’ I
rejoined: ‘I play for the School in my own colors
on my own terms. I would like you to understand
that if I am with you, I am not of you.’ There
was a hurried consultation among my fourteen fellow
players, and although their sense of outrage
was enormous, that was neither the time nor the
place to indulge it.</p>

<p>“The French were ‘taken on’ as they had never
been ‘taken on’ before. But the debacle was the
work of one man. Such a game as was played on
that occasion by ‘Cad’ Northcote was never seen
before or afterwards. According to tradition,
which to this day invests his pious memory, he
spent half his time in crossing the line of his adversaries,
and the other half in standing the opposing
three-quarters on their heads. He felt
himself to be equipped for the part of the man
of destiny. I believe the rout of our hereditary
rivals on that occasion came near to approaching
three figures.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say,” exclaimed the solicitor,
“that you are the great Northcote, the fellow
who led the English pack while he was still at
school?”</p>

<p>“No less.”</p>

<p>“Why, then I saw you play at the Rectory
Field sometime in the ’nineties. I remember you
had those damned Welshmen over the line three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
times in the first five minutes. You pushed them
all over the place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we pushed them all over the place. You
saw me at the summit of my fame. And I am
now coming to the point of my parable. From
those days of my inordinate success, which conferred
not only lustre upon myself, but upon my
school and all who were associated with me, I
became not only a hero, but a figure of legend.
The opprobrious title ‘Cad’ Northcote was
dropped as completely as though it had never been.
My lightest opinion was treasured, and heaven only
can tell us how many they were on every point
under the sun. I became a dictator where formerly
I had suffered infinite misery and persecution.
By a display of personal force criticism was laid
low; yet, sir, according to this theory of yours,
it must have been inimical to all who came within
its sphere of influence.”</p>

<p>“I would say so certainly; demoralizing alike
to its possessor, and to those who despised it in
its growth and abased themselves before it in its
flower.”</p>

<p>“Yet was it not with bated breath that you
inquired whether I was the ‘great’ Northcote?”</p>

<p>“Pray do not overlook the fact, my dear fellow,
that however much the average sensual mind may
deplore the false gods before which it kneels, it
has not the power to deliver itself from their thrall.
This passion to ‘excel’ is a flaw inherent in the
race.”</p>

<p>“It is at least pleasant to discover,” said Northcote,
“that the average sensual mind is unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to banish the sentiment of admiration from its
republic.”</p>

<p>“If it could,” said the solicitor, “there would
be an end of these abnormal egotisms of which
we have been speaking.”</p>

<p>“I do not agree,” said Northcote. “It is not
a thirst for admiration from which they spring,
but a thirst for power. And it is an uncomfortable
reflection for those who belong to your republic
that the world has been so arranged that
mere power will always have its devotees. How
lamentably your own practice breaks down before
your theory. You have reverence for me as a
player of football, and Tobin’s powers as an advocate
fill you with enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“True; and it is men like Tobin and yourself
who forbid any reconciliation between theory and
practice. A phenomenon is always inimical to the
society in which it appears. It may stand forth
as memorable and fascinating as you please, but
it does so at the expense of balance, law, and
reason. Your presence in the football match
ruined the game as a game, just as I have observed
that the presence of Tobin in a case has
been disastrous to the cause of justice.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you invoke the aid of Tobin on
every possible occasion.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Upon what pretext, may I ask, since you deplore
his gifts so deeply?”</p>

<p>“The answer is simple. To whatever extent
I may deplore the condition of things into which,
through no fault of my own, I have been projected,
beyond everything I am of a comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and conforming disposition. Therefore I make my
subscription to the things that are. I have none
of the reformer’s zeal; and it is one of the things
for which I am thankful.”</p>

<p>At this stage of the conversation the voice of
the cabman was heard from the roof.</p>

<p>“We’re in Norbiton, sir. Which house?”</p>

<p>“Straight on to the end of the road,” said Mr.
Whitcomb; “then first to the right, second to the
left, and it is the first house you come to at the
corner of Avenue Road.”</p>

<p>“How quickly we’ve come,” said Northcote.
“One would not have thought it possible to cover
the distance in this time; with a tired horse,
too.”</p>

<p>“The sound of your own voice may have been
as agreeable to you,” said the solicitor, “as it has
been to me. I confess it has passed the time very
well.”</p>

<p>Northcote deduced from the more indulgent air
of his companion that this imperious personality
of his, of whose possession he was so conscious
and upon which he built so much, had not been
without an effect. He was thinking of the victory
that he felt sure would crown his tenacity, when
the hansom drew up at the gate of a very comfortable-looking
suburban residence. It was girt with
a high stone wall, and stood in a pleasant plot of
ground amid tall trees.</p>

<p>As they got out of the hansom, the solicitor,
after searching his pockets in leisurely fashion,
collected four shillings and a sixpence and handed
them up to the cabman on his perch.</p>

<p>“Wot’s this ’ere?” said the cabman gruffly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
“This ain’t no use ter me, guv’nor. Yer promised
me a quid.”</p>

<p>“In one’s dealings with the criminal classes,” said
the solicitor, “one finds that the only method of
self-protection is the use of their own weapons.”</p>

<p>“Yer promised me a quid, guv’nor,” said the
cabman, who was too excited to follow the course
of this reasoning.</p>

<p>“May I say,” rejoined the solicitor, with great
suavity, “that a promise is considered to be a
thing of no particular value among the members
of the criminal classes.”</p>

<p>“Criminal classes! Wot!” cried the cabman,
in a gust of fury. “Breaks yer promises and
calls yerself a toff! Not a-going to part with that
quid. Well, guv’nor, we’ll just see abaht it.”</p>

<p>Emitting a string of foul expressions, the cabman
hopped down from his perch.</p>

<p>“Call yerself a toff? Give me that quid or I’ll
knock out yer —— eye.”</p>

<p>“Try,” said the solicitor, with a coolness that
his companion felt to be inimitable.</p>

<p>Inflamed a little by drink as well as by a sense
of injury, the cabman prepared to exact a summary
vengeance. Breathing slaughter he came at
Mr. Whitcomb with his fists in the air; and that
gentleman, stepping aside coolly and nimbly, hit
him with a hand ungloved for the purpose
a heavy blow in the face. The cabman dropped
like a log in the slush of the gutter.</p>

<p>“A broken nose,” said Mr. Whitcomb, turning
to his companion, while they stood watching the
unfortunate cabman gather himself slowly and
painfully together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“I feel for you, cabby,” said the solicitor, to
his rueful assailant, “but I can assure you this
is wholly in the public interest. Thieves and bullies,
as well as fools, have to be taught by experience.”</p>

<p>“Why the ’ell didn’t yer sye so?” whimpered
the cabman, as he strove in vain to stanch the
blood that poured from his nose. “’Ow the ’ell
should I know yer could use ’em? I piked yer
fer a toff in yer ’igh ’at and yer fur coat and yer
glass eye; ’ow the ’ell should I know yer could
use ’em?”</p>

<p>“That is for you banditti to discover,” was the
rejoinder of his fare. “It is perhaps my chief
recreation to thrash hansom cabmen in the interests
of society. I am proud to say your case is
one of many.”</p>

<p>“Blow me tight, a prize-fighter!”</p>

<p>“It is not too much to say I might have aspired
to that calling, if the somewhat material nature
of my ambitions had not summoned me to a more
lucrative if less honorable practice. Twenty years
ago I was considered rather useful with the
gloves.”</p>

<p>“Not so rusty nah, guv’nor,” said the cabman,
imperfectly mollified, and stanching his nose with
his sleeve. “Give us a extra bob an’ I’ll drive to
the ’orspital.”</p>

<p>“Here is your sovereign,” said Mr. Whitcomb.
“Training and education make one so punctilious
in regard to one’s word, although common sense
assures one that like the majority of your class
you are a rogue, a liar, and a bully; in a word,
a common pirate. Here is your money; and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the goodness to take yourself off as reticently as
you can.”</p>

<p>There was not a more astonished Jehu amid
the ranks of his London brethren than this unfortunate
specimen, as he climbed into the seat he
had left so injudiciously. Bestowing a succession
of brutal strokes of the whip upon his even more
unfortunate horse, he was lost immediately in the
sleet and darkness of the morning, leaving Northcote,
who was only slightly less astonished than
his bleeding and blasphemous self, standing at the
side of the solicitor against the gate of the latter’s
residence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI<br>

<small>MR. WHITCOMB’S FOIBLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In</span> moments of relaxation from my studies,”
said Northcote, taking his companion by the arm,
“I like to look upon myself as something of an
amateur of the human mind. I find a great fascination
in the endless nuances of the human character.
Permit me to say that I have never come across a
more promising subject than is offered by your own
personal complexity. Why in the name of the marvellous
did you batter that poor devil if you had no
intention of cozening him out of his money?”</p>

<p>“He suffered for one of my foibles. I am convinced
that a society of banded robbers is at work
to blackmail, bully, and despoil the peaceable citizens
of London. The law is powerless to touch
them, their operations are so cunning and are
ordered on so mean a scale. Therefore it would
seem to behove every stalwart private individual to
make war upon them openly; and I am proud to
affirm that a good measure of success has attended
my own puny efforts. It is quite possible that in
the course of these labors I may happen upon a retired
champion who chooses to eke out a well-deserved
leisure in a manner so unsavory, but in
the meantime I deal out a dozen broken noses a
year to this banditti.”</p>

<p>“You are an enigma, indeed,” said the young
man. “You professed just now to accept the things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
that are, that your last intention is to effect any sort
of social reform; yet look what you do. Again,
you profess to be a connoisseur in men of promise,
yet with your eyes open you reject the most authentic
specimen that has ever swum into your ken.
Further, you deride every form of ‘greatness,’
and despise every manifestation of the force that it
is your daily business to employ.”</p>

<p>“I am an enigma, right enough,” said the solicitor;
“yet, for that matter, so are we all. Who
shall explain himself? Who shall attempt it? I
preach one thing in all sincerity, yet with an equal
sincerity I practise another. Nature designed the
lymphatic Samuel Whitcomb to be the most consistent
man alive, yet see, my friend, how malleable
he is, how mobile, how entirely at the mercy of the
caprices that whirl about in himself. It gives me
an indescribable pleasure to thrash hansom cabmen;
my being craves for that form of relaxation; it is
its conception of true physical and intellectual enjoyment.”</p>

<p>“Did I not understand you to say,” asked the
astonished young man, “that these Promethean
labors were undertaken in the service of society?”</p>

<p>“Do not believe me,” said the solicitor, with his
rich laugh floating melodiously into the chill night
air. “I would deceive others with that pleasant
figment, but I do not impose on myself. It is a
sheer animal impulse, which I am powerless to
withstand, that causes me to break the noses of this
banditti.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Northcote, “I will wish you
good night. It has been a real pleasure to have met
you. The enchanting complexity of your personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
character will beguile me during my long walk
home. As for the brief that I hold, unless a whim
should cause you to obtain a postponement of the
trial, you will find it in my custody at the Old
Bailey on Friday morning.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my friend,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
as Northcote turned on his heel. “You had better
come in and have a drink before you start. It will
be a dreadfully cold and wearisome tramp back to
town through this slush in the small hours of the
morning.”</p>

<p>“My own foible is to walk the streets at night,”
said Northcote. “That is the only taste of real
freedom one enjoys in a city. It is only during
the middle of the night in a place like London that
one can think one’s own thoughts and breathe
God’s air. But as we do not appear quite to have
settled this momentous business of the brief, which
may mean so much more to society at large than
you can imagine, I will enter your domain and
drink one glass of your whiskey.”</p>

<p>The solicitor led the way thereto, unlocked the
front door with a latch-key, and Northcote found
himself in the interior of a modern dwelling-house.
It was furnished with perfect taste, fitted with every
luxury. The heavy mats on the floors muffled the
sounds of his feet; the warmed air that assailed his
nostrils was seductive and delicate after the bitter
inclemency from which he had taken refuge. Numerous
objects of vertu were scattered in every
nook, and the walls were lined with pictures that
astonished him beyond measure.</p>

<p>“Why, that is a Whistler—one of the two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
three!” he exclaimed, as he passed in the hall an
unpretentious-looking portrait.</p>

<p>“I got it years ago for a song, before they began
to be bought,” said Mr. Whitcomb modestly.</p>

<p>“And what is that stuck over the stairs? From
this distance it looks suspiciously like a Velasquez.
But surely that is in the Prado?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you confounding it with the companion
picture?”</p>

<p>“I had no idea we had this in England.”</p>

<p>“We have many things in England which fortunately
are not matters of common knowledge.
Every year they are becoming rarer, owing to that
scourge of nations, the press. If you value my regard,
you will forget that you have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“Did you get that also before they began to be
bought?”</p>

<p>“There is rather a strange story attaching to
that picture.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Northcote, with an anticipatory
eagerness; “that is where pictures are so
unlike women—they are worthless if they have no
history.”</p>

<p>“Possess your soul in patience, my friend,” said
the solicitor, with his rich chuckle; “the history of
the lady in the blue dress is not going to be told.”</p>

<p>“I must get a bit nearer,” said the young man,
with shining eyes, “Eh, she’s authentic! You
should be a proud man to keep that little lady under
your own roof.”</p>

<p>“As proud,” said the solicitor, in his unctuous
voice, “as any other Goth of a householder in his
snug suburban residence. Conceive the feelings of
the Huns when they overran Rome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Or the mob,” said the young man, “when they
sacked the Tuileries.”</p>

<p>“Is she not precious, the little girl in the blue
frock?”</p>

<p>At the sound of soft accents, Northcote, a
little startled, swung round to confront a lady.
She had come upon him noiselessly, and was standing
at his side.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Angel!” said Mr. Whitcomb, bestowing
a kiss upon her; “this is late for you. Allow me
to present Mr. Northcote, England’s future Lord
Chancellor.”</p>

<p>Northcote found himself to be holding the hand
of a singularly beautiful woman. All that art can
devise to enhance the sure, strong, and original
groundwork of nature was displayed about her,
chastely yet abundantly. Diamonds were strewn
in the flounces of her gown; three tight bands of
pearls clasped her throat; her shoulders gleamed;
her hair had the evanescent hues of the fleeciest silk—each
tress was the fruit of cunning and labor.
Yet through every curve of her gorgeous fairness
there peeped forth an almost quaint simplicity.
Her eyes were bright; her features, each of which
seemed to add a personal brilliancy to her expression,
had a lustre at once naïve and opulent, as becomes
one who accepts greedily all the thousand
and one glittering and delightful minutiæ that
money adds to life; who has both hands outstretched
to receive them; who carries them joyously,
like a child, to her bosom; who presses them
to her lips.</p>

<p>“His name is Northcote,” said the solicitor, patting
her white arm. “From the window of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
garret in Fleet Street he surveys the universe with
the haughtiest eyes imaginable.”</p>

<p>“How clever of him,” said the lady, in a little
melodious accent.</p>

<p>“Those eyes of his know everything,” said the
solicitor. “Before them human nature unveils the
whole of its mysteries. They range over the stars
in their courses, and he himself is familiar with
spirits. They have already promised to enable him
to conquer the world.”</p>

<p>“He must be what they call a favorite of fortune,”
said the lady, with engaging laughter. “He
must be clever.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he confesses it.”</p>

<p>“He is young,” said the lady, with a tender little
sigh.</p>

<p>She half-turned to meet the eyes of the young
man, and looked straight into their sombre depths.
Her own had a steadiness that was not at all imperious—they
were not even faintly insolent; the
candor of their inquiry was not so much as tinged
with encounter. An infant staring with its ruthless
curiosity into the human soul could have hardly
dealt less in implication. Yet the act itself seemed
to acquire for the young man the nature of a feat
so meaningless, yet so charged with meaning did it
appear. Only the support of a confident personal
beauty rendered it possible; yet it was nothing at
all, not even a comment, nor the formation of an
opinion, hardly the faint awakening of an interest;
all the same the blood had invaded Northcote’s ears.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t look at him so long,” said Mr.
Whitcomb, laughing. “You are making him shy.”</p>

<p>“Pray look at me as long as you please,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Northcote, who had recovered already his self-possession.
“And if you do really succeed in making
me shy, it may be shown to you one day as not
the least of your works.”</p>

<p>Her laughter rang out pure and clear like the
tinkling of steel.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is clever,” she said, “although he is so
young. I am so pleased. I am sure to like you, Mr.
Northcote; I like all men who are clever.”</p>

<p>“Is it that you have so little to fear?”</p>

<p>Northcote was now returning her frank look of
inquiry with a gaze of equal candor.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is truth in that,” she said sagely.</p>

<p>“Are not the powerful among us the most vulnerable
to your sex?” said Northcote gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true also,” she exclaimed, in a sort
of glee. “Why has it not occurred to one before?”</p>

<p>“If you speak much with this gentleman,” said
Mr. Whitcomb, “he will tell you a large number of
things that you will be surprised to think have not
occurred to you before.”</p>

<p>“He looks like that,” said the lady, betraying a
dimple. “I hope you don’t mind my looking so
much at your face, Mr. Northcote. It is one of
those fascinating faces that seem to give a new
meaning to old ideas.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are very well matched,” said Mr.
Whitcomb cheerfully; “and doubtless you will find
a great deal to say to one another. But it will not
be to-night, madam. Are you aware it is a quarter
to two? Now suppose you play us a bit of a tune
while we take a much-needed drink, and then I
shall send you to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>The lady led the way to a drawing-room. Luxury
and taste appeared there to have been carried to
their highest point. Northcote, whose delicately
poised sensibilities vibrated to the simplest of external
things, was fain to believe that paradise itself
could not have shaped a bolder contrast to that
bleak squalor which he had been doomed to inhabit
year after year. Somewhere apart in the sanctuary
of the spirit, the home of so many complex and
marvellous things, were chords responsive to the
challenge of the beautiful. They could thrill before
the manifestation of its power, even in that
which was exterior, material, unmeaning. These
cushioned enchantments, this bright bower, with so
exquisite an occupant casting slim jewelled fingers
across a wonderful instrument, sent a shock of intoxication
into his blood. At the same instant he
was conscious of a stab of shame. It was the flesh,
the draperies, the trappings to which his pulses
responded; it was not the magical secret which was
contained in the miniatures upon the walls, in the
passionate delicacy of the cadences which sobbed
themselves out liquidly under the siren’s touch of
this beautiful woman.</p>

<p>He stood in front of the cosy fire, glass in hand.
A soft warmth overspread his being. His eyes
glanced from the white shoulders of the enchantress
to the thousand and one hues which were blended so
cunningly in the carpets and tapestries. The subtle
playings of light and shadow, the mellow effects
of the atmosphere, the softness of the music, began
to assail his senses with indescribable pangs. He
feasted his eyes, his ears, his nostrils; they rewarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
him with gladness. His heart beat violently.</p>

<p>“These rare kinds of genius, are they not barbarous?”
he said, when the siren had ceased to
cast her fingers.</p>

<p>“It is like children lisping,” she said, half-turning
her head, with a smile that curved her mouth
entrancingly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man, “poetry, romance,
imagination are primitive; they belong to the childhood
of nations, to the dawn of new worlds. What
a divine inspiration these sweet-voiced children of
nature who are bought out of due time, these unhappy
Poles, Germans, and Frenchmen bring to
their despair. Instead of sitting down in black
coats to make their music into beef and mutton,
they should be tripping through the glades piping
to the birds, the trees, the bright air.”</p>

<p>“This is a mad fellow, my angel,” said Mr.
Whitcomb indulgently, “but if you are gentle with
him you may find him amusing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote will amuse me enormously,”
said the lady, with a demure glance.</p>

<p>“Is it thus you rebuke his madness?” the young
man asked.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I don’t think I have ever seen
a sanity that is quite so perfect.”</p>

<p>“Drop it,” said the solicitor, roguishly pinching
her ear. “Beware of dangerous turnings, my son.
She is quite prepared to play George Sand to anybody’s
Alfred de Musset. She even does it to the
greengrocer when he comes round with his barrow.
I understand they discourse divinely together
upon the subject of cabbages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“But Witty is too much the man of the world to
be jealous about it,” she purred.</p>

<p>“If Pussy hasn’t the opportunity to sharpen her
claws on a sofa or an ottoman, she doesn’t mind a
wicker-work chair.”</p>

<p>“Witty, darling,” said the lady, “I hate to find
rudeness keeping company with real distinction of
mind.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” expostulated Northcote, seeking
to measure her depth, “I consider that rebuke
to be much prettier than the one bestowed upon
me.”</p>

<p>“When, Mr. Northcote, did I rebuke you?”</p>

<p>“Did you not say I should amuse you enormously?”</p>

<p>“Is not that the only compliment a woman has
the power to pay nowadays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Noodle,” said Mr. Whitcomb, laughing;
“but don’t you see how young he is, and therefore
how serious? Who would call ‘enormously amusing’
a fitting compliment for one of the seven
champions of Christendom? This is a devil of a
fellow.”</p>

<p>“I can roar you like any sucking dove,” said the
young man.</p>

<p>“How it would thrill one to hear you do it!”
said the lady, enfolding him with large eyes.</p>

<p>“He is a man of destiny,” said Mr. Whitcomb;
“he carries a genie in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the lady, with clasped hands.</p>

<p>“One of these fine mornings he will stand the
world on its head.”</p>

<p>“O-o-o-o-h!” said the lady.</p>

<p>“And having done that,” said Northcote, “this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
amazing fellow will dig a hole in the universe for
to bury the moon.”</p>

<p>“I would that all men had ambition,” said the
lady, looking down at her shoe. “If Witty had
only a little of that precious salt which forms a
sediment at the bottom of every fine action he
would be one’s beau-ideal of a hero, a Christian,
and a philosopher.”</p>

<p>“Minx!” exclaimed the solicitor. “If it were
not for my ambition I should never rise from my
bed.”</p>

<p>“So this wonderful Mr. Whitcomb has no ambition!”
said Northcote. “You see I have found
his character so complex, that in my capacity of an
amateur of the human mind I am picking it out,
here a little, there a little, piece by piece.”</p>

<p>“You must give him no marks for ambition,”
said the lady. “But since when did you become
acquainted with him not to have found out that?”</p>

<p>“Since this evening at ten.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then, you are absolved. He will certainly
baffle you at first.”</p>

<p>“He is wholly incomprehensible to me. He is a
man of moods who oughtn’t to have any.”</p>

<p>The lady clapped her hands in a little ripple of
glee.</p>

<p>“How right,” she cried. “In a dozen little
words you have shown me the nothingness of my
own knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Of course he has, Vapid One,” said Mr. Whitcomb.
“Have I not told you he carries a genie in
his pocket?”</p>

<p>“Then that is why his eyes are so deep and
bright,” said the lady, turning to peruse Northcote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
again with an unfathomable coquetry; “and would
you not say, Witty, that the genie is in some sort
responsible for his mouth?”</p>

<p>“Is this public laying of one another upon the
dissecting-table a new parlor-game that has been
brought into vogue by the long winter evenings,
may I ask?” said Mr. Whitcomb, concealing a
yawn.</p>

<p>“Pray do not be insolent, Witty. The proper
study of mankind is Man.”</p>

<p>“In the words of Pope,” said the solicitor, turning
to replenish his glass.</p>

<p>“You can see how Mr. Whitcomb baffles me,”
said Northcote, who did not propose to lose the opportunity
of following up his clue.</p>

<p>“Is it his attitude to hansom cabmen that makes
him so dark?”</p>

<p>“That is contributory. But it is mainly because
he has come before me in the guise of a waverer
that I stand so much at fault. If one knows anything
about anything one would be prepared to
affirm that nature had designed Samuel Whitcomb
to know his own mind.”</p>

<p>“He does as a rule. I have never known him
waver in anything; but then, of course, it is only
quite recently that he has begun to associate with
dangerous persons who keep a genie.”</p>

<p>“Do you suggest that he is susceptible to such
a thing as a genie? Would it have a malign influence
upon him, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I would suggest it to be likely in the highest
degree.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, my young friends,” interposed
the solicitor at this point, with a broad good humor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
“Samuel Whitcomb does not propose to play the
part of the corpse at the lecture on anatomy.”</p>

<p>“You will help yourself to another drink like a
good boy,” said the lady severely; “and you will
please to say nothing until we have dealt with your
‘case.’ Your character need not fear the lancet and
bistoury of true science. Tell me, Mr. Northcote,
wherein he is a waverer.”</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to hear you put that question,”
said the young man, with a gesture of triumph he
did not try to conceal, “for now it is that I unfold
my tale.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII<br>

<small>THE FAITH OF A SIREN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">At</span> about ten o’clock this evening,” Northcote
began, “as I was kneeling in front of the fire—there
was not any fire, by the way, as it costs too
much to afford one sometimes—in my miserable
dwelling at the top of Shepherd’s Inn, the oldest
and most moribund of all the buildings in Fleet
Street, who should come climbing up to the topmost
story of the rickety and unwholesome stairs, under
which the rats have made their home for many
generations, but Mr. Whitcomb. And what do you
suppose was his business?”</p>

<p>“He wished to buy one of your pictures.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, I am not a painter.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was a chance of it, since they
say all very good painters are so poor. But perhaps
you are a little too fierce, although I am told these
impressionists are terrible men.”</p>

<p>“The painting of pictures is one of the few
things I have not attempted,” said the young man,
consenting to this interruption that he might sit for
his own portrait.</p>

<p>“Well, I should not say you are a writer of
fiction. They are so tame. Besides they are all
nearly as rich as solicitors.”</p>

<p>“Why not a poet?”</p>

<p>“Why not? although your fierceness would make
you a dramatic, not a lyric one. Still it is impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
for you to be a poet, because I am sure that
Witty would never have climbed up all those stairs
to your miserable garret—I feel sure it is a garret
with a sloping roof with a hole in it—”</p>

<p>“There is a pool under the hole which has been
caused by the percolation of water—”</p>

<p>“On to the atrocious bare boards, its occupant
being much too poor to afford a carpet. Yes, Witty
would never have climbed up to your garret if you
had been a poet. Or stay, he might, had you been
Mrs. Felicia Hemans. As you are a seeker of documentary
evidence, he has been known to recite her
poems, at the request of the rector of this parish, to
a Sunday-school party.”</p>

<p>“Base woman,” said the solicitor, with an air of
injury; “I claim to be an admirer of the poet
Longfellow.”</p>

<p>“Never, Witty, in your heart; it is merely your
fatal craving to be respectable in all things. But in
the matter of poetry you must be content to remain
outside. You would never have climbed those
rickety stairs to that cold garret to see John
Keats.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Featherhead, did I not tell you at
the first that our young friend was England’s future
Lord Chancellor?”</p>

<p>“I will never believe that; I will never believe
that his destiny is the law. His eye has amazing
flashes; and is there not a beautiful eloquence burning
in his mouth? I cannot think of him as rich
Witty, and successful Witty, and smug Witty, like
you atrocious lawyers. He is one who would be an
overthrower of dynasties, a saviour of societies.”</p>

<p>“You are letting your tongue wag, Noodle. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
you talk so much it will take the young man until
daybreak to unfold his story.”</p>

<p>“I am an advocate,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“An advocate,” said the lady softly; “yes, I
think you may be that. One no more associates
an advocate with the law than one associates a
poet with a publisher.”</p>

<p>“You would say,” said Northcote, “that it is the
function of an advocate to draw his sword for the
truth, for progress, for justice, for every human
amenity?”</p>

<p>“I would, indeed. Why, if one thinks about it,
surely it is nobler to be an advocate than to be a
poet or a soldier. One might say it was the highest
calling in the world.”</p>

<p>“Then let us say it,” said the young man, “for
I verily believe it to be so.”</p>

<p>“And what, pray, was Witty’s business with this
advocate?”</p>

<p>“They are going to hang a woman; and Mr.
Whitcomb, who to his infinite complexities and
many-sidedness as a citizen of the world adds a
leaven of the finest humanitarian principles, has
undertaken to save the poor creature from a fate
so pitiful.”</p>

<p>“To hang a woman!” said the lady, drawing in
her breath with a sharp sound. “Is it still possible
to hang a woman at this time of day?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said the young man. “They do it
in every Christian country.”</p>

<p>“Then the world has need for an advocate,” said
the lady, with horror in her eyes. “It is necessary
that we should have yet another champion for our
sex in Christendom. Yes, this was he whom Witty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
came to seek in that garret at the top of all those
rickety stairs.”</p>

<p>“He came to seek, and found no less a person,”
said Northcote. “And having found this authentic
champion of your sex, he gave him a mandate
to plead on behalf of this unfortunate creature, the
least happy of all its members.”</p>

<p>“What a moment of high inspiration for us
and for him,” said the lady, with a glance of tenderness.</p>

<p>“It was even as you say. But I would have
you mark what follows. Scarcely has he bestowed
these high plenary powers upon one whom he has
ventured to select from among all the great multitude
to champion your sex in the name of humanity,
than for a whim he withdraws his mandate.”</p>

<p>“Impossible; it would be an outrage upon
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; unconditionally and peremptorily he withdraws
his mandate.”</p>

<p>“Impossible; they will do the poor creature to
death.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they will do her to death. He who has
been called to the office of averting her doom has
decreed that she must walk to embrace it without
a friend to plead her cause before humanity.”</p>

<p>“Surely this cannot be; society itself must protest.”</p>

<p>“One expects it; yet things are as they are.”</p>

<p>The beautiful creature turned to the solicitor with
an almost royal air.</p>

<p>“What, sir, can you find to say in your defence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Mr. Whitcomb gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“I yield,” said he.</p>

<p>“You restore the mandate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes! My blood be on my own head,
but so it must be. It is beyond flesh and blood to
withstand such a pair. You, madam, are a sorceress;
and this fellow is the devil.”</p>

<p>“I am content to be a sorceress in the cause of
my unfortunate sex,” cried the lady; and turning
to Northcote added gravely: “And is it not high
time that we acquired a devil for our advocate?”</p>

<p>Northcote, who from the moment of her first
appearance had foreseen a victory, took her hand
to his lips impulsively, with an expression of gratitude.</p>

<p>“I hope this will be all right,” said the solicitor,
viewing his surrender with a rueful smile. “You
see it is the first time in my life that a foreboding
has overtaken me in the midst of action. Whether
it is the importance of the case, the obscurity of
the advocate, or a certain flamboyancy in his bearing
which is so repugnant to an English common
lawyer, I cannot tell; but let me confess that I
have already a premonition that I have been guilty
of a mistake. And I will go farther,” said Mr.
Whitcomb, with a wry laugh; “I even see ruin,
blue ruin for all concerned, hidden in this irresolute
act. Sharp little shivers go down my spine.”</p>

<p>“It is no more than the reaction,” said Northcote,
“which attends our highest resolves. Is it
not in such moments that a man truly measures
himself? It must have been at the fall of the
barometer that Samson was shorn of his locks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Is there not always a woman in these cases?”
said the lady. “This unfortunate creature whom
our advocate is to deliver from the gallows, may
she not be a Delilah of some kind?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII<br>

<small>BE BOLD, WARY, FEAR NOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> these words, lightly spoken, Northcote grew
conscious of an indescribable sensation which he
had never experienced before.</p>

<p>“If it were one’s custom,” he said, with a laugh
as wry as the solicitor’s, “ever to heed the note of
prophecy, one might discern it in your words. But
I will not do so. Since that dark hour in which
I summoned the genie, have I not adopted as my
device, ‘Be bold, wary, fear not’?”</p>

<p>“Now you come to mention it,” said the solicitor,
“it may be this talk of the genie that has
filled me with these forebodings.”</p>

<p>“That is very foolish, Witty,” said the lady.
“You have but to look into the eyes of our advocate
to know what it is and where it dwells.”</p>

<p>“He is quite entitled to keep one, of course, but
it is not usual to take it into society. I sometimes
think I may have a bit of a genie myself, but I do
what I can to keep it a profound secret from the
world.”</p>

<p>“Should a man venture to compliment himself,
Witty, upon the score of his reticence?”</p>

<p>“Would you not say,” inquired Northcote, “that
all our reticences had their roots in our cowardice?”</p>

<p>“I would love to say it if I dared. And I would
love to say of our advocate that his genie enables
him to fear nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Yes,” said Northcote, “you shall say that.”</p>

<p>“A man must have fear of some kind,” said
the solicitor, “if he is to succeed against enormous
odds.”</p>

<p>“There may be a place for it in his reflections,
but never in his resolves. Hence you will discern
how our reticence has its basis in our cowardice.”</p>

<p>“Subtle brute,” said Mr. Whitcomb, giving his
mustache a tug of perplexity. “He is entering
upon his special function of turning black into
white.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Northcote, “the subtlety is not
mine, but Francis Bacon’s.”</p>

<p>“Good, O Advocate!” said the lady, as she rewarded
him with bright eyes. “You do well to
confute the Philistine with a learned name.”</p>

<p>Again the young man carried the jewelled hand
to his lips. He felt the lithe fingers respond with
a sweet and secret motion.</p>

<p>“Rogue!” said the solicitor, laughing. “George
Sand and De Musset—Polly Whitcomb and the
greengrocer at the back door. Well, Mischief, as
you have entered into a compact with this fellow
to get him his way, play us another bit of a tune,
he shall keep his brief, and we will go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I knew we should force him to capitulate,” said
Northcote to the siren, as he arranged the stool
before the piano.</p>

<p>“What must I play?” she said, looking down
at her hands.</p>

<p>“Play me a bit of Beethoven, so that I may
take him out with me into the darkness of the
streets.”</p>

<p>She played three movements of a symphony, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
all his senses were submerged in the colors of romance.
These fragrant hues which had a delicate
aroma and pungency the imagination alone can
impart were of no time or country. There was
nothing that the mind could render as belonging
to itself; the faculties which embody the technical
were overcome by the tumultuous surgings with
which they were oppressed. He seemed to be transfigured
with the sense of joy, to be overpowered
with the knowledge that he was a living man, able
to breathe and to perform. The room had grown
small and heavy. He was consumed with an overmastering
desire for the spacious streets, for the
largeness of the universe.</p>

<p>“There is a bed for you here,” said the beautiful
player, almost before the last phrase had ceased to
vibrate under her touch. “We could not think of
turning you out at this hour.”</p>

<p>“I have not the least intention of staying,” said
Northcote. “The hospitality you have given me
already has been too profuse. I feel that I must
roam for the rest of the night in the open streets,
a Flying Dutchman of the London slush. Perhaps
I shall fancy myself to be the mad music-maker
of Leipsic, who walked at night on the ramparts
to weave his harmonies.”</p>

<p>“We cannot consent to your leaving us in this
manner,” said the hostess. “As for roaming
through the night, it will not be good for you. Nor
is there the least necessity why you should.”</p>

<p>“You forget his genie,” laughed the solicitor.
“The infernal thing will drive him all over the
suburbs of south London and send him home <i>via</i>
the Crystal Palace and Blackfriars Bridge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“He must not go to-night,” said the lady. “It
will be a perfectly horrid walk, and I believe the
sleet has turned into rain. It will be awfully cold
and unpleasant. Besides, if anything happens to
our advocate he will not be able to deliver this
unfortunate creature from her doom.”</p>

<p>“It is useless to argue with a man who has got
a genie,” said the solicitor. “I have tried the
experiment and therefore am in a position to give
evidence. What will overtake him in the way of
adventures I dare not conjecture; but of one thing
I am assured—no earthly power will cause him
to alter his determination.”</p>

<p>“Alas! I know it,” said the lady, sighing. “He
has a face that will yield to nothing.”</p>

<p>This diagnosis proved to be correct, at least as
applied to this instance, as in spite of the humane
entreaties of the lady, supported by a banter which
Mr. Whitcomb did not attempt to dissemble, Northcote
insisted on faring from their roof at a quarter-past
three. He bade them adieu with a cordiality
that was eloquent of a deep sense of friendship.</p>

<p>When Mr. Whitcomb returned to the drawing-room
after having shown the young man over the
threshold of his residence, he faced the lady with
a half-smile of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary chap,” he said. “He frightens
me, takes me out of my depth. There is such a bee
buzzing about in his bonnet that he might come
wofully to grief on Friday. If he does, there will
be none but myself to blame, for he is wholly without
experience.”</p>

<p>“I think you may trust him,” said the woman
softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Well, you are a mass of instincts, Miss Pussy.
And you counsel me to stick to your advocate?”</p>

<p>“I do, Witty; closer than a brother. I think
he is perfectly amazing. I think he will make the
fortunes of all who are connected with him.”</p>

<p>“Another Michael Tobin, would you say?”</p>

<p>“What a dunce it is,” said the lady, with an
indulgent sigh. “Michael and this man don’t inhabit
the same hemisphere. Michael is a dear fellow,
brilliant, clever, but only surface deep; this is an
ogre of a creature, a monster, deep as the sea,
of the proportions of the universe.”</p>

<p>“Come, I say, Mrs. Noodle; they don’t call that
sort to the bar. They might find the purlieus of
the law too confining.”</p>

<p>“If you have not yet learned to scorn my advice,
Witty, take care never to have this man against
you. If you have him on your side every time
you go into court, you will not have many lost
causes to record.”</p>

<p>“He is clever, I grant you, but the worst of it
is he knows it.”</p>

<p>“He is arrogant with power, Witty, which is
somewhat different, although it sounds the same.
I think he is a perfectly terrible man, and he looks
so big and great and deadly. Did you notice his
enormous hands? Did you observe his chest? And
that voice as soft as a flute yet as deep as an
organ?”</p>

<p>“You are completely conquered, Featherhead.
Yet you would not call this phenomenon precisely
beautiful?”</p>

<p>“Strength is more beautiful than symmetry, I
think; although I grant you that huge square jowl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
verges upon the horrible. It is far worse than
yours, my dear, although the poor hansom cabmen
are constantly mistaking it for that of an eminent
pugilist.”</p>

<p>“Well, little gal,” said the solicitor, “I shall heed
you once more, since your luck is proverbial. I
am prepared to back our latest discovery pretty
heavily, although I must confess that when in cold
blood I catch myself thinking of his infernal genie
he frightens me to death.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br>

<small>A JURY OF TWO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime the subject of these speculations
had entered the night. Food and wine in unaccustomed
quantities, the romance of events, the
spells cast by music and by a woman of signal
beauty and accomplishment, had provoked his energies
to an insurgency that had rendered them overbearing.
He walked like a whirlwind, up one
street and down another, in the chill wet darkness,
not knowing whither he was bound. Soft yet wild
strains of melody which still floated through his
brain mingled with a swarm of ideas which were
whirling about in it like so many atoms in a protoplasm.
He moved so fast in the endeavor to
keep abreast of his thoughts that at times he broke
into a run.</p>

<p>The seductive, amiable, and brilliant woman, who
had so nearly succeeded in casting over him a delicious
spell, began to fade from his consciousness
like the intangible occupant of a dream. She had
no appeal for him now. The feast at the restaurant,
that phase of color, warmth, and splendor
in which for an hour the squalor of his existence
had been dispelled; the struggle to retain the treasure
which had been entrusted to his keeping by a supernatural
agent; the bizarre incident of the hansom
cabman; and the personality of the genial god out
of the machine had now ceased to have significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Indeed one thing alone merged his faculties in
his overstimulated thoughts. It was the packet
which he could feel in the breast-pocket of his coat,
towards which his hands were straying constantly.
These pages of foolscap bound with red tape, were
they not his magic talisman? By that occult presence
had not his thwarted bleak and empty life
been changed into an electrical existence crowded
with glory?</p>

<p>His brain bursting with ideas, he began to run
faster and faster through the maze of endless
streets, lined with high garden walls, portentously
respectable dwelling-houses, lamps, shops, and secretive
silent-footed policemen. These frequently
flashed their lanterns upon him, for the manner of
his progress had an illegal air. Even at the height
of this orgy of freedom, the question shaped itself
with the oddest definiteness as to whether it would
not be expedient to curb his paces, since if he were
stopped, he feared lest he should be able to render
an account of himself that would be sufficiently
lucid to commend itself to the myrmidons of the
law.</p>

<p>When at last his exertions had thrown him out
of breath, and his frame did not respond with
quite the same unanimity to his passion, he stopped
under a lamp in the middle of a street on the side
of a steep hill, took out the precious document he
carried, and began to peruse it for sheer human
pleasure. He even pressed his lips to this prosaic
thing, with no less of fervor, indeed with more
abandonment than he had saluted the hand of the
sorceress who had been the means of restoring it
to his care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“I must make her my saint, I must burn candles
to her,” he muttered, recalling her image with a
sense of rapture.</p>

<p>As he stood under the lamp, a very large and
slow-footed policeman waddled up towards him,
trying doors and casting the light of his lantern
down the areas he passed. As he went by, keenly
scrutinizing the figure of the young man, yet pretending
not to notice it, Northcote hailed him.</p>

<p>“Where might I be, policeman? I am strange
to these parts.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the policeman slowly and with
effort, “you might be in Balham, but you ain’t.
Likewise, you might be at Charing Cross, but you
are not there, nuther.”</p>

<p>“I observe, policeman, that you have graduated
in the school of judicial humor,” said Northcote,
delighted by the suavity of outline of X012. “If
every man had his rights, which of course it is
utopian to expect, you would be adding lustre to
the bench. Your mental gifts fit you equally to be
a judge, a recorder, or a stipendiary magistrate.”</p>

<p>Such an exaggerated view of his merits produced
a deep-founded suspicion in the honest breast
of X012.</p>

<p>“If every man had ’is rights,” said the custodian
of the peace, speaking slowly and with effort, and
eying Northcote with the solemnity of a horse,
“you’d be took up on suspicion, young feller, and
charged with loitering with intent.”</p>

<p>Northcote dispelled the suburban quietude with
a guffaw.</p>

<p>“Being unwilling,” said he, “to impale myself
upon that spiked railing which calls itself the law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
I ought to be extremely careful to refrain in its
presence from the vexed and overmuch discussed
question of whether the badinage of its minions
is wit, wisdom, humor, or a veritable cesspool of
human inanity.”</p>

<p>X012 was so much astonished by these words
and the forcible mode of their delivery that he
pulled his whistle out of his coat, and proceeded
to toy with it in an irresolute fashion. Before he
had decided to summon aid by blowing it, there
appeared round the corner of an adjacent street
a second constable, in all essentials of bearing,
physique, and mental energy the perfect replica
of himself.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come, Bill,” said X012. “I’ve
got a rum one ’ere. I don’t know what he’s been
drinking, but you should just hear his languidge.
Here he was under this lamp, a-purtendin’ to read
a newspaper at twenty past four by the mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Noticed his mug?” said his confrère Z9.
“Bob Capper, the ’ousebreaker, who just done in
’is last seven stretch an’ was let out on license last
Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Got it in one!” said X012, not without enthusiasm.
“We ’ad better take him to the station
and have ’im searched.”</p>

<p>“This is the result of a misplaced jocularity in
the presence of professional wits,” said Northcote,
with an amiability that was viewed with considerable
disfavor by both constables. “I hope you
will forgive me, my friends. The only excuse I
can urge for impinging upon the prerogative of the
legal supernumerary, if I may so express myself,
is that as one day I am certain to be a judge, I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
it to be due to the lofty elevation I shall be called
to occupy, and of which I intend to be so signal an
ornament, to neglect no opportunity of acquiring
these cardinal principles of humor, dangerous,
double-edged implement though it be, which can
only be done by association with those past-masters
who as the crowning glory of our admirable legal
system inhabit it in choice perfection in all its
branches. I hope, my friends, I have made myself
perfectly clear.”</p>

<p>“Clear as mud,” said Z9.</p>

<p>“Impidence!” exclaimed X012; “downright
impidence! Certin to be a judge! Why, Lord love
me, young feller, if ever they ax you to be the judge
of a pair o’ pullets at a poultry show you’ll be
lucky.”</p>

<p>“Balmy,” said Z9, tapping his forehead with an
air of Christian pity.</p>

<p>“You are very probably right,” said Northcote.
“I suspect there is a basis of truth in this scientific
opinion which you have embodied in so expressive
an idiom. But at the same time I would ask
you, is it not a somewhat extreme view to take of
the mental condition of a barrister-at-law who has
been nominated to appear at the court of the Old
Bailey to-morrow morning at the hour of ten-thirty
to defend one Emma Harrison, who at that
time and in that place will stand her trial for wilful
murder?”</p>

<p>“A-going to defend Emma Harrison!” exclaimed
the constables. “Why, what will he be
saying next?”</p>

<p>“I do say that, my friends,” said Northcote,
with a note of imperiousness in his voice that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
not without its effect on these astonished minions
of the law. “And I want you both to stand back
a yard or two against the railings, while I advance
to the curb; and further, I want you for a few
minutes to imagine that you are the jury, and I will
rehearse the opening of my speech for the defence.
I shall begin something like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you now?” muttered Z9 to his companion.
“Well, if this don’t beat cock-fighting!”</p>

<p>Both these constables, overawed already by the
authentic manner of the advocate, were now devoured
by curiosity.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “I rise in my place with this
bundle of papers in my hand, which I shall not
consult, but shall cling to to gain confidence, and
I shall say: May it please your lordship and gentlemen
of the jury, this is a dreadful issue you are
sworn to try. Indeed it would be difficult for the
human conscience to conceive an ordeal more repugnant
to the moral nature of man, one in sharper
antagonism to those principles that are his priceless
inheritance, than is revealed to you by the situation
in which you stand. It is not by your own choice
that you come to take your places in this assembly.
It is not in obedience to your own instincts
that you have left your toil to subscribe to a law
which is not of your own making. I venture to
affirm this without fear, for is not this ordeal into
which you are thrown in deadly conflict with the
behests of that unfearing spirit who, nineteen centuries
ago, discovered the only possible faith for
His kind?</p>

<p>“It is as the inheritors, gentlemen, of an inimitable
tradition, not as administrators of a penal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
code, that I venture to address to you these words.
And let me tell you why I venture to address you
in this fashion. It is because the life of a fellow
creature is at stake; it is because sitting here in
conclave in this place you are enmeshed in the most
grievous ordeal that the fruit of human imperfection
is able, at this time of day, to impose upon
you. For that reason, gentlemen, I conceive that
you are entitled to take your stand upon a lofty and
secure platform to survey this issue, a platform
which has been raised for the oppressed, the unhappy,
and those who are doubtful of their way,
by the travail of the choicest spirit in the annals
of human nature.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you are called upon to adjudicate
upon the life of a woman. You are called upon
to do so at the bidding of a formula, whose hideous
and obsolete enactments are the fruit of an imperfect
culture of a partial and unsympathetic interpretation
of those laws to which every civilized
community owes its name. Gentlemen, you are
called upon to adjudicate upon the life of a woman;
you rate-payers of London, you gentle and devout
citizens, you to whom life has given as the crown
of your endeavor, as the consecration of your painful
daily labor, mothers, wives, and daughters of
your own.</p>

<p>“Yes, gentlemen, we must indeed ascend the
loftiest and most secure platform known to us, to
survey the ordeal that our own imperfection has
presented to us.</p>

<p>“You have heard the words that have fallen
from the lips of my learned friend, the counsel for
the Crown. You have examined the facts which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
he has marshalled before you. You have noted the
inferences which he has not been afraid to draw.
You have been thrilled by the union of a consummate
skill with a consummate learning. All that is
base, sordid, and unworthy in the human heart has
been stripped naked before your eyes. The smallest
acts of this unfortunate woman have been
shown to you as vile; even the aspirations which
are allowed to ennoble her sex have been rendered
abominable. Every kind of mental and moral
degradation has been made to defile before you;
for verily there is no limit to the talent of this
accomplished gentleman.</p>

<p>“That such a talent should have taken service
with an outworn formula is a great public danger.
For just as our common humanity is able to assure
us that the acts of the most wicked are not
always wrong, so those of the finest integrity would
not bear dissection at the hands of a cold and scientific
cynicism. Our every act has two faces.
One is presented to belief, the other to unbelief;
one is presented to truth, the other to error. And
as this penal code of ours, which we traverse constantly
with searchings of heart, is itself a survival
of a time of gross darkness, called into being by
unbelief and fostered by error, the acts of the best
and worthiest among us are liable to be visited by
the sword of the avenger, in other words by justice.
I am convinced that if any one of you gentlemen,
or any private citizen, was called upon to
rebut the most awful charge that can be levelled
against him, innocent as you might be, innocent
as he might be, it would be found immensely difficult,
I will not say impossible, to combat the deadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
array of inferences which would be marshalled
against you in the interests of this penal code by
one of the most talented of its servants. The mere
fact that you had come to stand your trial in this
noisome chamber, itself stained with a thousand
crimes committed in the name of justice, and that
a cruel chain of events had forced you to vindicate
your kinship with the divine will in the precincts
of this charnel-house—it is well, gentlemen, that
the windows are kept so close, for who would have
this foulness mingle with the air of London?”</p>

<p>For the best part of an hour in that raw winter
morning, with a drizzling rain falling incessantly,
did Northcote continue to rehearse his address to
the jury. The amused intolerance of his hearers
yielded to an intense interest. They had been present
in court on many occasions and had heard these
things for themselves, but never had they listened
to a voice of such dominion, of such volume and
majesty, a voice capable of such burning appeal.
They stood merely at the threshold of the argument,
it was true; but the art of the orator unfolded
it, made it clear. His natural magic, his
incommunicable gift, rendered it with the harmony
of music, so that before the end these oxlike custodians
of the peace, far from growing weary of
their situation, began to view with emotion the
injury that threatened an outcast from society.</p>

<p>“Go on, sir,” said Z9 humbly; “you’ve the gift
and no mistake. They’ll not be able to hang her if
you talk to ’em that way.”</p>

<p>“This is not quite the form it will take, you
know,” said Northcote, whose exertions had been
so great that he was breathing heavily and dripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
with perspiration. “It is only a sort of opening
roughly blocked out. It will have to be rendered
a bit finer, so that it pins them like a fly on
a card.”</p>

<p>“You’ll pin them to-morrow, sir,” said Z9;
“you’ll get your verdict, see if you don’t!”</p>

<p>Z9 spoke with the proud consciousness of one
who can respond to an intellectual pleasure. X012,
with a mental organization of less delicacy, although
impressed by so rare a personality, yet retained
the reverence for facts of the honest Englishman.</p>

<p>“He’ve a gift right enough, Bill,” said X012
magisterially, “but the law is the law to my mind;
and black’s black an’ white’s white. If this woman
done the crime—I don’t say she did, mind—the
law will ’ang her. An’ rightly, too. This gentleman
is a book-learned man and a horator,—I
know that because I heard Gladstone on Blackheath,—but
the law is the law and horatory ain’t
a-going to alter it.”</p>

<p>“I am obliged to you both for your courtesy,”
said Northcote, with a perfect gravity, “and my
obligation is even the deeper for the opinions you
have been good enough to express. You are prototypes
of the twelve honest men I am going to
sway; and I take it that if my address were to
be launched in its present immature shape, you, sir,
would record your vote for an acquittal, and you,
sir, for the severity of the law?”</p>

<p>“The law is the law I say,” said X012, inflating
his chest before the honor of this direct canvass
of his intelligence, “an’ words is words, although,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
mind you, sir, I respec’s you, because I heard Gladstone
on Blackheath.”</p>

<p>“I assume,” said Northcote, “that although you
admired Gladstone’s oratory, you did not allow it
to influence your judgment?”</p>

<p>“That’s ’is pig-headedness, sir,” said Z9.
“That’s just like a Tory; great horators can talk
till all’s blue, and then they can’t get daylight into
a Tory. ‘The law is the law,’ says he; an’ if it
come to, he’d hang his own fayther.”</p>

<p>“I take it, policeman, that you try to keep an
open mind, a mind accessible to new impressions?”</p>

<p>“That is so, sir,” said Z9. “I say with you,
sir, that although the law is the law, human natur’
is human natur’. And although Bill ’Arper is just
a common p’liceman with on’y one stripe, an’ not
a lawyer like you, sir, nor a beak, nor a judge, ’e
never goes into court and a-takes off ’is ’elmet but
what ’e feels ’igh-minded.”</p>

<p>“Then, policeman, regarding you in the light
of a juryman, it is most probable that you would
want mercy to be extended to the prisoner, in spite
of the law, if you happened to be in your present
frame of mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I should in my present frame o’
mind.”</p>

<p>“More shame to you, Bill,” said X012; “you
are a nice bloke to be a copper, an’ no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Close it, ’Orrice,” said Z9, with a restrained enthusiasm;
“you bloomin’ Tories are so thick’eaded
you don’t know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” interposed the advocate,
brushing the water from his brief, “as I observe
you to be on the brink of an altercation, I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
hasten to discharge you with my best thanks for
your kind attention in order that you may have it
out. For the subject will engage your powers
worthily; pursue it, and it will take you into
strange places. But before I leave you to do so,
may I ask where I am?”</p>

<p>“Bottom o’ Sydenham ’ill, sir,” chimed both
constables as one.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my friends. I must leave you
to ponder this subject or I shall not get home to
breakfast.”</p>

<p>The two myrmidons of the law stepped together
into the middle of the road to watch this astonishing
figure ascend out of their ken.</p>

<p>“Well, if ’e don’t beat all as ever I ’eard!” was
the comment of Z9.</p>

<p>“’E’s not got ’er off yet, and ’e won’t nuther,”
rejoined X012. “She’s a wrong un; an’ if they
let ’er off, it won’t be fair to peace.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’e can talk. ’E kind of got ’old of me.
I could ha’ stood there all day.”</p>

<p>“’E kind o’ did me too, but I should shake him
off in court. You’ll see the beak will put a muzzle
on ’im. He warn’t talkin’ law, and you’re no good
in court unless you talk law. The old bloke and
them K. C.’s will not stand that sort o’ lip, see if
they does.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’ere’s the sergeant comin’. But just to
show there’s no ill-feelin’, I’ll ’ave ’arf a pint with
you, mate, that ’e gets her off.”</p>

<p>“Make it a pint, matey. A pint seems more
legal.”</p>

<small>TRUTH’S CHAMPION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Northcote</span> had only a hazy notion of his whereabouts.
He had never been in these high latitudes
before. He had a dim idea that London lay “over
there;” but upon ascending the steep hill that lay
before him, he found that “over there” was
merged in the dark and enormous bulk of the
Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>“Whitcomb was right in his topography,” he
laughed. “This is the route he predicted I should
take; therefore it is a perfectly fair inference to
regard it as the wrong one.”</p>

<p>He hailed yet another minion of the law, who
no less than his brethren was communicative.</p>

<p>“You are going away from London as fast as
your legs will take you,” said Z201, and proceeded
to set a course which in itself was so intricate that
the young man by no means pledged himself to
follow it.</p>

<p>The terrific central energy still driving him, the
wayfarer strode forth through the rain with an
undiminished vigor. By now his clothes were saturated
and lay upon him heavily. But nothing
could abate the force of these concentrated fires
which bore him so lightly mile after mile. Not
only did they burn with splendor, but also with a
vital clarity. His lips moved with the phrases that
sprang upon them; the sense of dull power, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
unused native force, which had oppressed him like
a nightmare during many nights and days, had
been fused all at once into an immense fecundity
of expression. Each minute blood-vessel that
formed a web round the ball of crystallized energy
that was his brain was big with its own peculiar,
original, and special idea. The strangest vistas
had opened before his eyes. His faculties in the
first flush of their self-consciousness had grown
insolent and overbearing.</p>

<p>How could a body of common citizens hope to
stand against the battery that would be directed
upon them! All the subtleties of the sophists, all
the enthusiasms of the creeds would be as naught
in the presence of such an overweening personal
force. How could such insignificant fragments
as these, the mere excrescences of the universal
scheme, who could not make a mind among them,
hope to retain the all-too-precarious standard of
their probity when touched by the wand of the
magician? He laughed aloud to the rain when his
thoughts reverted to the two perplexed constables
he had left at the bottom of Sydenham Hill; and
how, in spite of the tentativeness of the effort, as
his talent had mounted in him, so that presently
its irresistible force had seemed even to surprise
himself, these two stolid, unemotional Englishmen
had nodded their heads in approval, and had hung
breathless upon his words. Only one of God’s
great advocates could hope to perform that miracle
under a gas-lamp in the wind-swept streets on a
wet and chill winter’s morning. The old mystics,
delivering with a divine <i>naïveté</i> their surprising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
message to mankind, could never have accomplished
a feat more wonderful.</p>

<p>His eyes veiled in darkness, his head high-poised
yet thrust forward, his mouth and nostrils filled
with cold and deep draughts of air, his whole being
was surrendered to an orgy of freedom and power.
For the first time since he had come to maturity
he had found an occupation for his ferocious
energies. It was no unworthy task by which they
were confronted. Thirty was usually the age at
which genius elected to give to the world its first
masterpiece. And was it not as seemly that an
advocate should rejoice in a theme as the statesman,
the musician, or the poet? This first essay
should be as complete, as audacious, and as worthy
of the sanction of the best minds of the time, as
the <i>chefs-d’œuvres</i> of other representative spirits.
It should stand as a landmark in an art as little
understood as that of truth itself.</p>

<p>Old men on the Woolsack, the most reverend
seigniors of the law, advocates who had received
the homage the age is accustomed to lavish on a
scanty pretext, should stand aghast before an
alarming iconoclasm of which he would be the
pioneer. His ideas should prove so revolutionary
that these practitioners, complacently drawing
their emoluments, should foregather to turn this
magnificent ruffler out of his inn. The scathing
criticisms which the elect of all ages launch against
a Jesus, a Galileo, or a Wagner, before the world
has grown accustomed to their strangeness, he
would be called upon to support; for would not he
alone be the true advocate, the heaven-born, immortal
one, while they would remain, as always,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
complacent performers of tricks which they mistook
for the operations of their specific talent, subscribers
to conventions that were shallow and
nonsensical and in open enmity to the idea of justice
for which they stood as the self-satisfied
expression.</p>

<p>As he raced along in the company of these wonderful
thoughts through the south of London, he
recognized in himself all the signs that declare
Truth’s authentic champion. It would be his to
deliver more than one rueful blow upon the close-locked
portals of pedantry. “The purblind old
man who dares to occupy the seat of judgment,
his authority shall be traversed, it shall be rent in
pieces. As for that amazing creature who will dare
to stand up for the Crown, who will propose to
do to death a human being with that bleak and
irascible voice, and the operations of that arrested
growth he calls his intellect, an awful example will
have to be made of him.”</p>

<p>There was no end to the succession of deserted
streets. Water swam in shallow pools along the
black pavements which seemed to reflect the color
of the sky. The numerous lamps, picked out as
so many dull, yellow balls in the surrounding blackness,
suffused their oppressive rays along the long,
flat surfaces so that they appeared to shine without
giving forth a radiance.</p>

<p>How vague and vast seemed these early hours
before the dawn! They did not contain a living
soul. The sky, the streets, the dark houses, the
bare trees in the gardens and at the sides of the
roads were soundless, empty, destitute of life. A
quietness so profound appeared uncanny on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
outskirts of pandemonium. But astonishing, desolating
as it was, it seemed to aid the furious brain
that was borne so fast in its midst. There was
only the echo of the advocate’s own feet, which
came weirdly from across the way, and the high
and labored breathing of his own body.</p>

<p>By the time the hour of seven chimed out from
the half-dozen neighboring steeples of a population
that was beginning to cluster much closer together,
he divined that he was pressing nearer to the heart
of the metropolis. He did not stay to inquire of
the occasional wayfarer who was abroad in these
regions, but set his face into the ruck of the streets,
where the dark forms of the houses rose like an
impenetrable and endless forest. No fears assailed
him as to whether he would reach his home—the
coldest, most inhospitable home that was ever called
upon to harbor a spirit with such widespread,
space-cleaving pinions.</p>

<p>His feet seemed to devour the pavements. His
stride was great, elastic, and unflagging; it was
propelled by the lungs, heart, and muscles of the
athlete. In the swing of the arms, the lunge of
the limbs, the lissom sway of the body, there was
fine physical power, and the seething engines that
presided over this massive yet elastic framework
were like the boilers of a locomotive which eat up
the miles without fatigue. When excited into action
on the football field the feeling was always
upon him that no puny human agent could stay
his course. The feeling was upon him now in an
intensified degree. With will and muscle coöperating
to overstride the darkness, he longed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
opposition to declare itself that he might trample
it down.</p>

<p>Near eight o’clock he recognized Waterloo
Bridge and the cold Thames below stealing like
a felon through the vapors of the dawn. With
a stupefied surprise he awoke to the sensation of
being launched once more into the sharp and too-definite
business of the time. The pavements
were now swarming with people, the roads with
omnibuses, cabs, and vans. Traffic was belching
out of every street; clerks and seamstresses were
scurrying to their employments, masticating their
breakfasts as they went. Vendors of newspapers
and hawkers of food were tearing the gray air
to pieces with their cries. He emerged from the
orgy of his passion to find that he was up to the
throat and being stifled in pandemonium, even before
he was aware that his feet had entered it.</p>

<p>The lines of palaces across the river, towering
tier upon tier above the embankment, with their
majestic bulks half-thrust through the curtain of
December mist which the first streaks of day had
seemed to thicken, fell upon the imagination of the
wayfarer, who had slackened his pace all at once
to a footsore limp as he crossed the bridge and
crept towards them. At a distance they stood insolent,
aloof, and cynical. He could hardly believe
that in one of these wonderful caravanserais
he, the starving, the friendless, and the solitary,
had eaten and drunk only a few hours before. It
was not feasible that such palaces as these could
touch a life so obscure at any point. Penniless,
friendless, lacking even life’s common necessaries,
in the midst of six millions of people, who contended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
rudely with the first weapons that came to
their hands to enforce their claims, how could he,
whose coat was in holes, whose pockets were empty,
have penetrated to the Mecca of their gods?</p>

<p>Limping into the Strand as the clock at the Law
Courts chimed the hour of eight, his imagination
was assailed, not with their unmeaning mass of
architecture, but with that unseen and grisly bulk
which only the eye of his inner consciousness
could apprehend. A shudder convulsed his veins.
Less than thirty short hours hence the gladiator
would be called into the arena. He would have
to face the lions with no defence for his nakedness
except a small shield in the use of which he had
had no practice, and a sharp but untried spear.</p>

<p>Climbing up the steep stairs to his garret, his
nostrils were affronted as they had been on so many
other occasions by the foulness of the heavy and
noisome air. What a labor it was to reach the
locked door at the top of the highest, the darkest,
the most unpleasant story! His fibres had grown
strangely slack, his breathing was no longer joyous
and free. The mighty engines of his mind
had ceased suddenly to vibrate; those pulses which
had been so overweening in their insolence could
only flutter now. He had fallen without a warning
from his eminence. His whole being was enveloped
in a despicable flaccidity, a despicable
weakness, as he turned the key in the lock and
entered his garret.</p>

<p>He recoiled from the dismal scene that met his
eyes with the shudder that one gives in plunging
into icy water. As he stood on the threshold all
the phantoms of his previous despair sprang upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
him from the walls of his chamber and seemed to
throw him down. There was the cold grate with
the gray ashes in it still; there the lamp that had
left him in the darkness. The table was there
with its pile of law-books that he had conned with
the sickening patience which tortured him so
keenly. Strewn over them were fragments of the
writings which had eaten away the flower of his
intelligence without bringing him a shilling to fill
his belly or to pay his rent. Enveloped within them
was the piece of lead by whose aid and with a
skill so ferocious he had destroyed the rat. The
confectioner’s paper was there that had contained
his dinner; also the crumbs which remained to
testify to its nature. On the mantelpiece was the
burned and dirty old pipe which he had cherished
so much, the only friend of his adversity; on the
floor was the pouch that had not a grain of tobacco
in it. The pool of water was still in the corner,
underneath the discoloration of the plaster in the
low sloping roof.</p>

<p>How cold it was! Everything in this horrible
apartment seemed to be rendered icier, more dismal,
by the callous gray beams that stole through the
grimy windows with a sullenness that hardly merited
the name of light. Ah, that window with its
outlook on oblivion! It all came back to him with
the indescribable pangs of the knife, that the night
before he had leaned out of it, bareheaded, open-mouthed,
his eyes and nostrils cut by blasts of sleet,
and had cried his haughty challenge to a world
that grovelled so far below him in the mire.</p>

<p>It was all very hideous, yet this Titanic despair
filled him with a deep sense of poetry. He realized,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
even as he stood now confronting it for the thousand
and first time, that whatever the future might
hold in her womb, never again would he be pierced
to these depths whose very immensity urged the
proud rage to his eyes. Yes, there in the cynical
eyes of the morning lay the stained and battered
old table to which the previous evening he had
pressed his eyes to summon the genie. What torments
of impotence, of baffled and thwarted power,
must those eyes have undergone before they could
prevail upon their royalty to stoop to such an
act.</p>

<p>He took from his pocket the bank-note, half his
fee, which the solicitor had given him at the restaurant,
and held it up to a gaze that was as scornful
as that of a young god who has not yet learned
to accept as a matter of course the powers that
render him immortal.</p>

<p>Not again would he suffer want. He had made
his choice. In a tragic moment his faintness had
forced him to his knees. He had summoned the
mischievous imp who showers gold upon poor mortals
in order that it shall stultify, poison, and corrupt
them. Already he could taste success. There
was a faint aroma of it in the dregs of the wine
he had drained the previous night. There was a
slight nausea upon his lips. There had been something
beyond mere fatigue in the enervation with
which he had climbed those stairs. For once the
great muscles had seemed to flag. Yet not again
would they know the chastening brutality of want.
Indeed his despair already was beginning to seem
a holy and pure condition. He foresaw, as he
stood gazing upon its pinched face, crinkling as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
did so the bank-note between his hands, that the
future would be casting back to it perpetually as
the tomb of his godhead, in which he put off those
spiritual splendors in which his nature was once
enveloped, those sanctified things which were native
to himself, in order that he might embrace those
other things that were the birthright and the measure
of the meanest natures.</p>

<p>Through the open door came the sound of footsteps
on the stairs. They were shuffling and uncertain,
and belonged to an old woman, who wore
a shawl and a faded black bonnet, and who crept
into the room with little toddling steps.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mrs. Brown,” said Northcote, turning
to confront her; “rather late, aren’t you? It is
a quarter-past eight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am,” said the old woman, in a precise
manner. “My youngest grandchild is dying.”</p>

<p>“How old?”</p>

<p>“Five and a half, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of what is she dying?”</p>

<p>“Diphtheria, sir,” said the old woman humbly.</p>

<p>“And if the poor little kid dies that will reduce
the number of small orphans in your family to four,
will it not?”</p>

<p>“It will, sir.”</p>

<p>Northcote stood looking at the old woman for
a moment and then changed the subject abruptly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown,” he said, “I have had a windfall.
For the time being I am a rich man; and I
may say that one of these days I expect to be very
much richer. And although your poor little grandchild
is dying, I think we owe it to Providence
to celebrate this occasion in a fitting manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Never mind about the fire and the water for my
bath. I want you to get a basket and do some
shopping, somewhat as follows: one frying-pan,
one pound of the choicest Wiltshire bacon, three
moderately fresh eggs if money will buy them,
which I expect it will not, one pot of marmalade,
one pound of the most expensive butter and a loaf
of bread, a pound of tea, price half a crown, and
a pint of milk. Now get along, if you please, and
I will light the fire.”</p>

<p>The blank stupefaction on the face of Mrs.
Brown conveyed to Northcote that he had forgotten
to give her the money.</p>

<p>“I am so unaccustomed to have the handling of
money,” he said, “that I have forgotten to give
it to you. This is a note for ten pounds. See that
no one robs you of the change.”</p>

<p>The stupefaction on the face of the old woman
appeared to deepen as her fingers closed over this
unheard-of treasure.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know that I dare trust myself with
it, sir, along the Strand,” she said weakly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Northcote. “Just make the
fire—a real good one, mind, and you can use all
the coal that is laid by, because at one fell swoop
I am going to order a ton—and I will do the shopping
myself. Where is that big basket in which
you bring home the washing?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” said the old woman, passing behind
a curtain at the far end of the room which concealed
a bed.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Northcote. “Providence is working
for us. It intends that we shall do ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
well. And my last words to you are, don’t spare
the coal.”</p>

<p>“I will not, sir,” said the old woman, discarding
her air of stupefaction in favor of her habitual
preciseness.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI<br>

<small>A JURY OF ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Northcote returned with the basket heavily
laden in one hand, and a frying-pan, aggressively
new, in the other, his dismal chamber had
already been transformed, for a fire was burning
bravely, a kettle was singing upon it, the pool of
water in the corner had been mopped up, the floor
had been visited with a brush, and books and papers,
two tables, and three chairs had received wholesome
discipline from a duster.</p>

<p>“I could have done it all as well myself,” said
Northcote, surveying this transformation with grim
eyes, “although I do not deny it has the efficient
professional touch. But I would have you to know
I am a man of my hands. I am also a man of
affairs. I have purchased extensively; and I am
proud to say the best goods in the cheapest markets.
I have ordered a ton of coal, although where we
are going to put it I don’t quite know. Now, these
things I surrender to your care; and in half an
hour you will have the goodness to serve up a royal
breakfast for two persons. In the meantime I will
have a shave and a tub.”</p>

<p>The young man’s operations behind the curtain
were conducted on an extensive scale, to judge by
the noise and splashing that accompanied them.
Yet presently he emerged with a well-scraped chin,
a skin glowing with cleanliness, his ragged mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
of hair reduced to a semblance of order, and his
person arrayed in an extremely shabby and unfashionable
but perfectly dry suit of clothes. The tea
was at hand to be made, the pot heated, the eggs,
bacon, and toast were delightfully warm and laid
before the fire. And in accordance with instructions
the table was set for two persons, with the
blunt knives and forks and the decrepit crockery
of his establishment.</p>

<p>“Will you wait till the other gentleman comes,
sir?” asked the old woman.</p>

<p>“What other gentleman, Mrs. Brown?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman who is coming to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t very well, seeing that she turns
out to be a lady.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir.”</p>

<p>“You, Mrs. Brown, are that lady. You will
please sit just there, as near to the fire as you can
get without burning yourself. I propose to make
the tea, for I am so expert in the art that I yield
to none. And I shall ask you to pour it out, while
I proceed to serve the eggs and bacon, which look
perfectly delicious.”</p>

<p>The charwoman, however, betrayed no sign of
assenting to this arrangement.</p>

<p>“I am sure, sir, it is meant in great kindness,”
she said humbly, “but I could not think of such
a thing. You see I have been in good service, sir,
and I beg your pardon, sir, but it is never done.”</p>

<p>“‘Never’ is a dangerous word to employ, Mrs.
Brown,” said Northcote, towering over the old
woman in a formidable manner. “In fact, I allow
none to employ it to me. Sit down, if you please,
and pour out the tea, and just have the goodness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
imagine yourself the Lady Elizabeth Who-was-it,
famous alike for her breeding and her beauty, while
I shall endeavor to consider myself that distinguished
nobleman, the Earl of What’s-his-name.”</p>

<p>“The Lady Elizabeth Plumptre, sir, and the Earl
of Widmerpool.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now I say, ‘Betty, my gal, have
an egg with your bacon?’ and you reply with a
quiet ease and distinction of manner, ‘Yes, papa,
if you please,’ Now then, down you get into your
chair, and spare me the necessity of arguing the
point. I am so apt to lose my temper if I argue
the point.”</p>

<p>The old woman, who was too much in fear of
him to risk anything of the kind, took her place
at the table immediately.</p>

<p>“One of these days,” said Northcote, handing
her an egg and some bacon on the only plate that
did not happen to be cracked, “I should like you
to meet my mother. She is a very notable and good
woman, with a remarkably resolute conception of
her duty, which all her life she has rendered bluntly
and directly without ever speaking of it to a human
soul. She has ordered her life in the manner that
she deems necessary to the rôle of an eminent Christian.
She has brought up her only son in simple
and pious resolves, educated him quite beyond her
means, has found him money when in order to do
so she has been compelled to deny herself life’s
common necessaries, yet has asked alms of none,
and at Christmas time never omits to dispense charity
to others.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see your mother, sir,” said the
charwoman, folding her hands meekly and sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
very upright on her chair. “I am sure she is a
very good lady.”</p>

<p>“One of those noble narrow women, Mrs.
Brown, upon whom life bears down so heavily.
Yet she carries out her programme with a greatness
of spirit which is almost demoralizing to one
who tries to look at things as they are. I don’t
know what there is in her life that carries her on
so victoriously; for one never hears her utter a
complaint against the buffets she has received from
fate, or against the restrictions that her dismal surroundings
impose on her nature. I have never
heard an impatient word upon her lips, yet every
morning, summer and winter, she rises at the hour
of five, performs those domestic functions that can
bring no satisfaction to her, and presently goes
forth to labors still more arduous and equally devoid
of meaning. What there is to carry her on
I don’t know. Why that inflexible spirit has not
been broken these many years I cannot conjecture.”</p>

<p>“She has got into the habit of going on, sir,
I suppose,” said the charwoman.</p>

<p>“The habit must be a very strange one, Mrs.
Brown, when to-morrow is always the same as
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It is like being a clock, sir, which goes on
because it has been wound up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I never found a clock that could wind
up itself. Every clock must have some kind of
a key.”</p>

<p>“It is God, sir, who is the key,” said the charwoman.</p>

<p>“That throws us back,” said Northcote, “to our
original necessity to have a religion. To my mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Mrs. Brown, you have indicated that need in a very
lucid and practical manner. And how, Mrs. Brown,
as you appear to have given some thought to these
things, do you suppose this reticent mother of mine
views this God who holds the key to the watch,
who winds it up and keeps it going? How would
you say she regards Him personally?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she doesn’t think about Him much,
sir. Perhaps as a girl she troubled her head about
Him a bit; but when she got older and had to take
heavy burdens on her shoulders, she was always too
tired to think of Him, except when she said her
prayers.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there have been times when in
her great fatigue she has fallen asleep while she
has been in the act of saying them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose there may have been,” said
the old woman.</p>

<p>“So, then, you would say there is nothing definite,
forceful, all-compelling about this God of
hers? You would say He had no particular personality
to speak of?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps He is very real to her, sir, just as to
the watch the key must be very real that winds
it up and keeps it going.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, Mrs. Brown, you have never by any
lucky chance arrived at the reason why He does
wind you up and keep you going? Yet surely you
have asked yourself the question why it is necessary
that you should be wound up and kept going.”</p>

<p>“I may have done, sir, now and again. But
then it has been a wicked thought.”</p>

<p>“It is an intensely natural thought, and the wickedness
of sheer undraped nature is one of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
hard doctrines I have never been able to accept.
When in the depth of winter you have laid an old
skirt on your bed because you did not happen to
possess an extra blanket, and you have crept with
your shivering limbs into the cold sheets, I suppose
you have asked yourself occasionally why you who
do not even perform the humble functions of a
clock, since you keep no time, should yet be wound
up and set going, when, as a matter of choice, you
would prefer to remain in bed in the morning and
be allowed to sleep on forever?”</p>

<p>“There are my five little grandchildren, sir, who
have no mother or father.”</p>

<p>“They would go to the workhouse; and the
state would transform them into honorable, capable,
and industrious citizens with even greater efficiency
than you would yourself.”</p>

<p>“The workhouse, sir, is a very disgraceful thing
for a respectable family.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you impale me on another spike of your
religion. Its points are fixed at a sharper angle
than you are willing to allow. For I would ask
you, is it not enough to enrich the state with five
healthy and able-bodied citizens without being
called upon to maintain them at one’s own expense?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the old woman,
“but when you have children of your own you
may not say so.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt that you are right. By exercising
as keenly as possible the very inadequate number
of wits with which nature has seen fit to arm
me, I am able to discern that the more reasonable
we become the less do we order our conduct by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
light of reason. As you suggest, it is extremely
probable when I become a father, if I am ever called
to that beatitude, I shall rise every morning from
my bed to prevent my children going to the workhouse,
however strenuously reason may urge that
the workhouse is their natural and appointed home.
And assuming, Mrs. Brown, that I am not marked
out for the honor of paternity, that crowning
achievement of every citizen, why then should I
rise from my bed—that is, assuming that I regard
the person who presumes to wind up the watch to be
a meddlesome busybody, a bore, and a nuisance?”</p>

<p>“If you work very hard, sir, you will have no
time to think such thoughts,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>“It is, I suppose, the satisfaction of depriving
yourself of the opportunities of thinking such
thoughts that brings you here every morning of
the year at a quarter to eight to tidy up the garret
of a starving materialist who is bleeding to death
of his ideals?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you might say partly that and partly
to help to bring up my grandchildren.”</p>

<p>“Well, my good woman, if it is partly to bring
up your grandchildren, why, may I ask, do you
continue to toil on behalf of this person, when for
two months past he has paid you no wage, and
may I ask also why have you lent him sums of
money, when you must have been aware that it
was in the highest degree unlikely that it would
ever be paid to you again?”</p>

<p>“I have had no time to think about it like that,
sir.”</p>

<p>“That is not a very strong answer, Mrs. Brown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
I felt sure I should be able before long to impale
this religion of yours upon a paradox. And I suppose
that when you put this shrivelled old hand
that I am holding into that ridiculous old dogskin
purse of yours, which must have been an heirloom
in your family in the year one, you had not time to
reflect that you were robbing your poor little grandchildren?
You had not time to reflect that the
twenty-five shillings which you lent a weak-natured,
self-indulgent sentimentalist in order that he might
not be turned out into the street would keep them
in boots for a year?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say I had not time to think about it,
sir, but I could never have seen you turned out into
the street without a roof above your head.”</p>

<p>“Why could you not, Mrs. Brown? It was no
part of your duties to provide a home for a stalwart
and able-bodied young man who was living in idleness,
when you had your five little, orphan grandchildren
to consider.”</p>

<p>“I did not look at it in that light, sir.”</p>

<p>“Surely it was very wrong of you to fail to
do so. One would think a reasonable, right-minded
person would hardly need to have it pointed out.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the old woman nervously, “I
beg your pardon, I’m sure; but even if I had seen
it in that way I might not have acted upon it.”</p>

<p>“Then I grieve to say, Mrs. Brown, that you
appear to have no very exact standard of probity.”</p>

<p>“I—I—I’m sure, sir, I always try to do what
is right.”</p>

<p>The charwoman had become the prey of a deep
confusion.</p>

<p>“But,” said Northcote, sternly, “I have just had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
your own assurance that you do not. You would
not, it seems, scruple to rob your poor grandchildren
to gratify a whim; indeed, it may be said you
have robbed them to gratify one. If I had to prosecute
you before a jury of twelve of your honest
countrymen, I could easily get you put into prison.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the old charwoman, beginning
to tremble violently before this grim realism, “I—I
am sure I have always tried to do my duty.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Mrs. Brown, you can scarcely
be said to have a conception of what is your duty.
At least the best that can be said for that conception
is that it is arbitrary, perverse, contradictory. Expedience
is the only duty known to the laws which
regulate all forms of nature. The man called
Jesus, the chief exponent of the contrary doctrine
which appears to have had some kind of attraction
for you, received a somewhat severe handling when
He ventured to show Himself upon the platform;
and you who in your dumb and vague and invertebrate
manner have been seeking to imitate Him in
one or two minor particulars, owe it to the generous
forbearance of the recipient of your charity that
you do not find yourself in prison. If the Crown
in its expansive vindictiveness were to instruct me
to prosecute you in what it is pleased to call a
‘court of justice,’ woe would betide you.”</p>

<p>The old woman grew as pale as ashes when confronted
with the stern eyes of this advocate who
turned white into black so easily.</p>

<p>“Why—why, sir,” she stammered, “you—you
will make me think I have committed a murder
if you go on!”</p>

<p>“I think I might do that without much difficulty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
It would be quite simple to indicate to you
in a very few words in what manner the Almighty
has already seen fit to mark the sense of His personal
displeasure. Is it not your own conduct, do
you not suppose, which has provoked Him to strike
down your innocent little grandchild with diphtheria?
And if the child dies, which we will pray
it will not, what would be easier than to render you
responsible for its death? You see that is the worst
of evil, it is so cumulative in its effect. Once it has
begun its dread courses, who shall predict their
end? A good action is self-contained and stops
where it began; a bad one fructifies with immortal
seed and practically goes on for ever—<i>vide</i> the
poet Shakespeare. Why, you are eating nothing.
I am afraid I am spoiling your breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I didn’t know I was so wicked,” said
the charwoman, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Opinions are easily formed. As for reputations,
they can be made and unmade and made
again in an hour. But might I suggest, Mrs.
Brown, that if one happens to be righteous in one’s
own eyes, it does not very greatly matter if one
goes to jail to expiate so pious an opinion. Do I
make myself clear?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t say I am good, sir, but—I hope I
am not a downright bad one.”</p>

<p>“Well, to relieve your feelings, we will take it
that you are a nebulous half-and-half and somewhat
unsatisfactory sort of person who blindly follows a
bundle of instincts she knows less than nothing
about, just like a dog or a cat or a rabbit. And is
not that what this elaborate moral code of ours
throws back to if we take the trouble to examine it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
And is not one entitled to say that a dog is a good
dog, a cat a good cat, a rabbit a good rabbit, just
as faithfully as it follows the instincts under its
fur, whatever they happen to be? I have taken this
excursus, Mrs. Brown, and have ventured to theorize
a little, quite unprofitably, I grant, and at the
risk of causing you some ill-founded alarm, because
to-morrow I have to exercise all the talents with
which the good God has endowed me in the cause
of an extremely wicked woman who has committed
a murder. Her crime is of a vulgar and calculating
kind, perpetrated in cold blood; there is not a rag
of evidence to save her from the gallows; but
Providence has called upon me to attempt to save
her from the fate she so richly merits. And there
is an instinct within me, her advocate, for which I
am at a loss to account by the rules of reason and
logic, which calls on its possessor to save this
abandoned creature at all hazard. If I obey that
instinct I shall be a good advocate and a bad citizen;
if I disobey it I shall be a good citizen but a
bad advocate. Yet if I obey it I shall have fulfilled
to the best of my ability the legal contract into
which I have entered, and in so doing I shall be
called on to commit a serious misdemeanor against
human nature. On the other hand, if I disobey it
I shall be causing human nature to be vindicated in
a becoming manner, yet shall be guilty of an equally
serious misdemeanor against myself; and further,
I shall be false to the interests of my unfortunate
client whose money I have taken, and render myself
indictable for the offence of entering into a contract
which I have wilfully refrained from carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
out. Please have another cup of tea, and kindly
pass the marmalade.”</p>

<p>Northcote having shifted the ground of his
reasoning from the personal to the abstract, the
old woman regained sufficient confidence to pour
out the tea without spilling it.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Northcote, “if you were in my
position, would you try to enable one whom you
knew to be a murderess to escape the gallows?”</p>

<p>“If I might say so, sir, I would try to have nothing
to do with her at all.”</p>

<p>“In other words, you would rather starve than
take her money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think I would.”</p>

<p>“And cause <i>you</i> to rob your poor little grandchildren?”</p>

<p>“I—I—don’t say that, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let us be as logical as we can. Again, would
it not cause me to rob my poor old mother who has
contributed her all towards my education, which I
put to no useful end?”</p>

<p>“You would be honest, sir.”</p>

<p>“Honest, do you say! Do you call it honest to
pervert and misapply the money my mother has
lavished on my education?”</p>

<p>“Might you not use your education, sir, in some
other way?”</p>

<p>“You would have me till the fields or be a clerk
in an insurance office. Would that be honest in the
sight of God, who has placed an instinct in me
which I disobey? Surely one would say the truly
dishonest man is he who is unfaithful to his nature.
Had we not agreed upon that? If a man knows
that he was designed by God to be an advocate, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
he not called to practise? Why have the gift to
prove that white is black and black is white if that
gift is not to be carried to its appointed issue? If
I do not barter it for a means of livelihood by proving
the guilty to be innocent, how am I to discharge
the higher function of proving the innocent to be
not guilty? If, in my cowardice, I decline to go
into court lest I save those who ought not to be
saved, think of the innocent persons who will perish
for the lack of a true advocate.”</p>

<p>“If we could only get to the real intention, sir,”
said the charwoman solemnly, “of Him who winds
up the watch and who is Himself the key, perhaps
these things might not worry us. But God moves
in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Northcote, rising from the breakfast-table,
“there we have the fruit of all that our
curiosity can yield to us. The power may be given
to us to show that blue is green, but what does it
stand for in the presence of the dread materialism
of our religions?”</p>

<p>The advocate took three sovereigns from his
pocket, three sovereigns which he had yet to earn,
and placed them in the palm of the old charwoman.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown,” he said, “in the bleak and uncomfortable
eyes of science your virtue will not
bear inquiry; but if it were possible to take a plebiscite
of the opinions of your fellows as hastily as
possible upon the bare facts, before a professional
advocate had a chance to pervert them, I do not
doubt that you would be voted to a position among
the elect. I believe myself that there is a greater
amount of purely disinterested nobility among all
sections of society than is generally known. Fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
shillings I owe you for services rendered;
twenty-five for your timely contribution towards
my rent; and here is a pound with which to pay the
kind doctor who is going to thwart the Almighty
in His intention of causing your small grandchild
to die. One of these days, as I say, Mrs. Brown, I
hope you may meet my mother, for I would like to
render to you the homage that all men desire to be
allowed to render to good women.”</p>

<p>He seized the blackened, shrivelled, and not particularly
clean hand and carried it to his lips.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br>

<small>MESSRS. WHITCOMB AND WHITCOMB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the old woman had cleared the table of
the breakfast things and she had gone away, Northcote
sat nearly two hours in his easy chair at the
fire, whose grate had never been allowed to consume
so much fuel since it had been in his occupation,
and with the aid of his brief proceeded to rehearse
all the points of the case as they presented
themselves to him. Warmth, food, and rest had
overthrown his weariness, and his mind which in
its operations was habitually so energetic began to
shape and docket every conceivable aspect of the
matter that could be of the slightest service to the
accused. His reasoning was so amazingly copious
that he foresaw and proceeded immediately to
guard against a very real danger.</p>

<p>He might easily overdo it. The jury would not
be men of education to whom fine points would appeal.
Most probably they would be petty tradesmen
whom it would be impossible to touch through
the mind at all. He must take aim at their emotions.
“I must use,” he said to himself in his
mental analysis, “not a word beyond three syllables,
and I must keep to the language of the Bible
as well as I can. All my little pieces of embroidery,
all my little bravura passages must bear that
singularly excellent model in mind; its power of
touching the commonest clay is so unfailing. Happily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
in the course of my somewhat eclectic studies
it has not been neglected. But beyond all I must
try to get my address quite fine and close. One
word too much and the whole thing fizzles out in
a haze of perplexity. For that reason I am afraid
I must reject some of my choicest and neatest
thrusts at the moral code, which ought to tickle to
death all minds with a gleam of humor. No, I
must deny myself those bright excursions in which
the cloven hoof of the artist betrays itself, and put
my faith in a few common tricks performed with
mastery. They at least should set up the honest
English grocer on his hind legs and make him purr
like anything.”</p>

<p>Before the ingenuity of this keen intelligence
those obstacles which were bristling everywhere
in the case, which to the average mind would have
appeared insurmountable, began rapidly to melt
away. It was with an ill-concealed joy that he shed
the lime-light of paradox on each point that presented
itself. That array of facts which a judge
and jury of his countrymen would hug to their
bosoms as so many pearls they could positively hold
in their hands he would disperse with a touch of
his wand. In the ripeness of his talent he foresaw
that it would cost him no labor to demolish the
evidence, to turn it inside out.</p>

<p>The world is full of great masterpieces that have
been created out of nothing, haunting and beautiful
things which have been spun by genius out of
the air. And are not feats like these more wonderful
than the exercise of the natural alchemy of
change by which fairness is turned into ugliness,
poetry into lunacy, good into evil, truth into error?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
The constructive faculty is rare and consummate;
when it appears it leaves a track of light in the
heavens; but the faculty of the demolisher is at
work every day. Northcote was conscious that he
was a born demolisher of “evidence,” of those
trite dogmas, those brutalized formulas of the
average sensual mind. When he looked for truth
he sought it at the bottom of the well. On the
morrow for the first time he would give free play
to his dangerous faculty.</p>

<p>When he had blocked out and brought into harmony
the main lines of his address to the jury, it
occurred to him that his powers might receive an
additional stimulus if he saw the accused, exchanged
a few words with her, brought himself
into intimate relation with her outlook. Up to
this point she had been no more than an academic
figure, around whom he had woven detached, somewhat
Socratic arguments. He felt that to see and
to know her would be to place yet another weapon
in his hands, wherewith he would be enabled to dig
another pit for those whom he had already come
to look on as his, no less than her, deadly adversaries.</p>

<p>Already he was a little amused by his own complacency,
the conviction of his own success. There
was that curious quality within him that forbade
his evoking the possibility of failure in so great
an enterprise. He was so grotesquely sure of his
own power to triumph over arbitrary material
facts. Such a sense of personal infallibility could
only spring from the profoundest ignorance, or
from talent in its most virile and concentrated
form. For what was more likely than that on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
inspection the accused would present one of the
most abandoned figures of her calling? Was it
not highly probable that nature, who takes such
infinite precaution to safeguard her creatures, had
caused this woman to assume the shape of a hag,
a harpy, a thing of loathsome, terrible abasement?
In that case, how would he dispose of evidence in
its most salient form? How would he dispose of
that immutable instinct, that deep conviction which
is conferred by personality?</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the accused, by the aid
of one of those miracles of which the world is so
full, were to present the outlines of actual personal
beauty, through whose agency common sensual
minds are appealed to so easily, how slight would
his difficulties be! In that event, so far as her
advocate was concerned, the gilt would be off the
gingerbread, his achievement would cease to be
astonishing. Indeed, so finely tempered was his
arrogance that to undertake the defence of one of
this kind would be distasteful to it, so small would
be the field afforded for personal glory. Rather
than have to deal with one who could be trusted
to be her own most efficient advocate, he would
prefer that a veritable harpy out of a sewer should
be placed in the dock. Could he have been allowed
the privilege of choosing a theme for his powers,
he believed that he should best consult the dictates
of his talent by asking for a commonplace, unillumined
woman of forty to be put up.</p>

<p>Deciding at last to seek an interview with the
accused, he set forth to the offices of his client in
Chancery Lane. On his way thither he occupied
himself with drawing the portrait of the ideal subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
as his mind conceived her. She would be
forty, with her hair turning gray. She would
be a plain, drab, slightly elusive figure, cowed a
little by life, the privations she had undergone, and
the ignominy and terror of her situation. The
positive, the actual would be to seek in her; she
would offer no target for too facile sympathies.
Her inaccessibility to all suggestions of romance
or of picturesqueness would lend to her predicament
that extreme peril which it would be her advocate’s
chief glory to surmount. All the same,
he desired no ghoul, but a human being. She
might be visibly stained, buffeted, common, broken,
devoid of a meaning to eyes that were unacquainted
with the poetry of misfortune, the irony of blunt
truths; yet let a few rags of her sex remain, let
her be capable of humiliation, of being rendered
in piteous fear.</p>

<p>At the offices of Messrs. Whitcomb and Whitcomb
in Chancery Lane he was informed that the
senior partner was anxiously awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Ah, here you are at last!” exclaimed the solicitor,
rising to receive him. “I thought you would
have been round before.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you only honor a silk gown with a
consultation in his own chambers?” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“Chambers, you call them! Well, did we not
hold it last night?”</p>

<p>“One cannot very well hold a consultation with
one’s client before one receives one’s brief.”</p>

<p>“What dignity!”</p>

<p>“Is it not at least half the stock in trade of
mediocrity?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“What modesty! Do I take it that the rather
formidable ’Ercles vein of last night is really no
more?”</p>

<p>“You may not. It is waxing higher and
higher.”</p>

<p>“Defend us, gentle heaven and pious gods!”</p>

<p>“A truce to these pleasantries. Put on your hat
and take me to the jail to see the accused.”</p>

<p>“You are going a little fast, my young friend,
are you not? Is it wholly necessary that you should
see the accused? Is it wholly to her interest or to
yours?”</p>

<p>“Wholly, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Well, before we get as far as that, I am particularly
curious to know what line you have decided
to take. Is it too much to ask that you have
decided not to adhere to the acquittal? Speaking
for myself, I must confess that the more consideration
I give to the question, the less do I like that
idea. Tobin would certainly have taken the line
of insanity.”</p>

<p>“Last night you were good enough to inform
me of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, my young friend, what is good enough
for Tobin should be good enough for you.”</p>

<p>“That also you were good enough to inform me
of last evening. But, my dear fellow, pray do not
let us go over this ground again. Unfortunately
Tobin and myself do not inhabit quite the same
intellectual plane.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately that appears to be the case,”
said the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Tobin’s is the lower,” said the young man
blandly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Tobin will be glad to know that.”</p>

<p>“I hope he may. After to-morrow he will be
the first to admit it. But once more I crave to be
allowed to conduct this case in my own way. I
can listen to none; so be a good fellow, put on your
hat, and come along to see the lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say that for a youngster who is
asked for the first time to conduct the defence in
a capital charge you don’t lack confidence in yourself.”</p>

<p>“If I did I should not be holding the brief.”</p>

<p>“There is something in that. And in any case
you will have to have your way now. It is too
late in the day to stand up against you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb pressed his bell and a clerk appeared.</p>

<p>“I want permission to interview Emma Harrison.
Will you ring up the prison and see if you
can get the governor to give it?”</p>

<p>The clerk withdrew.</p>

<p>“They are not likely to refuse it?” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“They ought not to be,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
“but when you are confronted with Mr. Bumble
in any shape or form, your motto must always be,
‘You never can tell.’”</p>

<p>“Arbitrary brute,” said the young man with
vehemence, “I hate him altogether.”</p>

<p>“I also; but one should always do him the justice
of conceding that he has arduous duties to perform.”</p>

<p>“Presumably that is the reason why he aggravates
difficulties of those who are called to help
him in performing them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Is not that what we agree to call ‘human nature’?
But really I think it is the duty of every
citizen to think of him tenderly. He means well.
He is not a bad fellow at bottom.”</p>

<p>“I have no patience,” said the young man truculently.
“Mean well!—not a bad fellow at bottom!
Why, he and his satellites are the custodians
of the life and liberties of the whole population.
One wonders how many innocent lives have been
sworn away by this fat-witted blunderer who is
barely able to write his own name.”</p>

<p>“You are too strong, my son. His responsibilities
are immense; the wonder is that he plays up
to them in the manner that he does.”</p>

<p>“You are all members of the same great and
far-reaching society; you have all sworn allegiance
to one another. Mediocrity arm in arm with Mediocrity;
Law and Order arm in arm with Law and
Order.”</p>

<p>“Insolent dog!”</p>

<p>“Better the insolence of the dog than the blind
ineptitude of the donkey. The barking of a dog
can frighten a rogue, but the braying of the ass
fills every fool with courage. If <i>he</i> is allowed to
lift up his voice, why not <i>I</i>? is what Mediocrity
is ever asking of itself. And up goes your own
private and personal bray. The other ass says,
‘Good Lord, what a clear and beautiful note!
Upon my word, I have never heard anything to
compare with it.’ And you reply modestly, ‘My
dear fellow, if you could only hear your own
clarion tones, you would not say that. My own
are modelled upon them, I assure you.’ ‘Well,
my dear friend,’ the other ass eagerly rejoins, ‘if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that is <i>really</i> the case, you are eligible for election
to our Academy.’ ‘Oh, my dear sir,’ say you, with
your hand on your heart and tears in your voice,
‘you overwhelm me with honor. This is the proudest
moment of my existence.’ ‘Not at all, my dear
fellow, tut! tut!’ says the other ass; ‘great privilege
to have you among us. And there is only one
rule, you know, to which you have to subscribe.’
‘Ah!’ you exclaim, in an awed whisper. ‘The
rule is quite simple,’ says the other ass, putting his
great flabby lips to your long furry ear. ‘It is
merely that every member of our distinguished
brotherhood shall unite in extolling his confrères.’”</p>

<p>Happily the clerk reappeared at this moment,
just as the solicitor, chuckling furiously, was preparing
to launch a veritable thunderbolt.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said to the clerk, and suddenly
whisking away his head to laugh.</p>

<p>“Sir Robert Hickman’s compliments, sir, and
Harrison’s legal advisers may see her in consultation
at any time.”</p>

<p>“There, what do you say to that!” said the
solicitor, casting a merry glance at the young advocate.</p>

<p>“Courteous fellow,” said Northcote; “one R. A.
to another R. A.; it is perfectly charming. I trust
that in accordance with latter-day practice you keep
a reporter on the premises, in order that these high-toned
amenities may be communicated to the press.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you are perfectly incorrigible,”
said the solicitor, sticking his hat on the back of
his head and insinuating his portly form within
the folds of his imposing outer garment. “But one
of these days you will know better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“When I am old enough to be eligible for election,
I dare say; in the meantime let me rejoice
that I am not yet brought to heel.”</p>

<p>Laughing at the vagaries of each other, advocate
and client went out together, called a cab, and drove
to the prison.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII<br>

<small>TO THE PRISON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had Northcote entered the vehicle
than his mood underwent a curious transformation.
His heart began to beat rapidly, his hands to shake,
his knees to tremble. His brain grew so hot that
a vapor was thrown in front of his eyes. Extraordinary
emotions overcame him to such a degree
that he could not discern any of the faces in the
street.</p>

<p>“You are very quiet,” said the solicitor, after
awhile.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say,” said the young man, in a
voice which in his own ears sounded thin and high-strung.</p>

<p>“Why not talk? That is your <i>métier</i>. You
were much more amusing last night on the way
to Norbiton.”</p>

<p>“Somehow I don’t feel as though I have anything
to say. My head is so full of this affair.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it too much or it may get
you down,” said Mr. Whitcomb, puffing quietly
at his cigar; “although to-morrow you are certain
to be in a horrible funk, as it is the first job
of the kind you have ever had to tackle. Nor will
it make it the easier for you when you reflect that
the line you have decided to take will add immensely
to your difficulties.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb spoke with the quiet incisiveness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of one whom experience has rendered callous.
From the leisurely candor and nonchalance of his
manner a trial for murder was made to appear of
rather less moment than the obtaining of a judgment
in a county court. Such coolness contrasted
so oddly with the young man’s own perturbation
that he was thrown completely out of conceit with
himself.</p>

<p>“I suppose you played cricket, Whitcomb, at
that highly fashionable seminary of yours?” said
Northcote abruptly.</p>

<p>“I was a ‘wet bob’ myself,” the solicitor rejoined;
“but I think I know why you ask the question.”</p>

<p>“It is like sitting with your pads on waiting for
the fall of the next wicket when you are playing
for your ‘colors.’”</p>

<p>“I agree,” said the solicitor, “that there are
few things so disagreeable as that. But you are
bound to have a wretched time until the case is
over. It is for that reason that I continue to urge
you to heed the counsels of experience.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will see her first,” said Northcote tenaciously.</p>

<p>That air of self-confidence which had tried the
patience of the solicitor so extremely had vanished
altogether from the manner of his youthful companion;
for to Northcote’s horror, every phase of
the defence which, with so much elaboration, he
had already prepared, every word of the memorable
speech to the jury which had been packed
away sentence by sentence had passed away out of
his consciousness so completely that it might never
have been in it. Pressing through the crowded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
traffic with a vertigo assailing his eyes and his ears,
and a paralysis upon his limbs, his mind was a
blank which might never have been written upon.
Pray heaven this would not be his condition when
he rose to-morrow in the court; for what is comparable
to the despair that overtakes an imperious
nature when it is publicly abased by a physical
failure? In imagination he was already sharing
the sufferings of the young Demosthenes when derided
by the populace.</p>

<p>At last came the dread incident of the hansom
stopping before the gateway of the prison. The
portals rose mournfully through the twilight of
the December morning. While the hansom stood
waiting for them to revolve, a little company of
loafers and errand-boys collected about the vehicle,
and regarded its occupants with curiosity not unmingled
with awe.</p>

<p>“Lawyers,” said a denizen of the curb to a companion,
whose world like his own was cut into two
halves by the huge wall of the prison.</p>

<p>“Ugly——!” said his friend, spitting with
extraordinary vehemence upon the wheel of the
vehicle.</p>

<p>The huge door, studded with brass nails, swung
back soundlessly upon its invisible hinges, and the
hansom passed over cobbles under an archway that
seemed to reverberate so much with the sound of
its progress, that Northcote felt his brain to be
shattered. He was unable to witness the little
drama that was enacted behind him, of the great
door shutting out the row of solemn faces, standing
upon the dim threshold of the outer world to peer
into the gloomy precincts of oblivion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The courtyard seemed to consist of low doorways
with gas lamps burning within them, endless
expanses of wall, windows heavily barred, and extremely
official-looking police-constables. The little
daylight of the streets through which they had
passed had diminished sensibly.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb led the way out of the hansom
as it stopped at a doorway at the end of the
courtyard, slightly less insignificant than the rest.</p>

<p>A policeman without his helmet, but with three
stripes on the sleeve of his tunic, and whose hair,
glossy with grease, fell over his low forehead in
the form of a fringe, came out of the semi-darkness
to receive them.</p>

<p>“If you will take my card to the governor I
shall be obliged to you,” said Mr. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“Yessir,” said the constable, with a deferential
alacrity touched with a slightly abject humility.
“Will you please to step this way, sir, and mind
your ’at, sir, against the top of the door?”</p>

<p>They followed the policeman along a gaslit passage
which seemed endless. Their boots echoed and
reëchoed from its stone flags up to and along the
low, white-washed ceiling. Ascending a flight of
steps they were shown into a room through the
iron bars of whose window a few irregular beams
of daylight struggled painfully, and arrived in
such an exhausted condition that they appeared to
be quite at a loss to know what to do when they
had entered. The room was small, warm, and so
full of bad air that Northcote found the act of
respiration difficult. Three or four massive chairs,
covered in brown leather, were disposed in the corners,
while the middle was in the occupation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
a table, upon which was a bottle filled with water
with a glass fitting over the top of it.</p>

<p>“The atmosphere of this place makes one feel
ill,” said Northcote, when the constable had borne
away Mr. Whitcomb’s card.</p>

<p>“They have another apartment which will make
you feel a lot worse than this,” said that gentleman
cheerfully, unbuttoning his coat and providing
himself with a chair. “Take a seat and
make yourself quite at home. It will take our
polite friend with the hair at least three-quarters
of an hour to penetrate through morasses of red
tape and officialdom in its most concentrated form
into the governor’s parlor and then to get back
again to us. I have known him take an hour.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord,” said Northcote, “I shall be dead
long before that.”</p>

<p>“Pretend you are Dante, and try to think out
the first canto of your ‘Inferno,’” said Mr. Whitcomb,
taking a crumpled copy of the <i>Law Journal</i>
out of his coat, fixing his glass, and proceeding to
peruse it with admirable spirit and amiability.</p>

<p>Northcote remained standing. He was too completely
the victim of the emotions that had been
excited in him to simulate composure. He walked
up and down the room in nervous agitation, and
examined the bare walls and the grated window.</p>

<p>“I see they have revived this flatulent controversy
in regard to the value of circumstantial evidence
in the capital charge,” said Mr. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“One would certainly say it ought always to be
admitted under the greatest reserve,” said Northcote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“It would be impossible to work without it in
almost every trial for murder.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall tell the jury to-morrow, overwhelming
as in this case it may seem, to reject it
altogether.”</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose the judge will tell
them, may I ask?” said Mr. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“I am expecting a bit of a duel between us,”
Northcote replied. “But if he can undo the work
I have set myself to accomplish, he is a better man
than I take him to be, that is all.”</p>

<p>The solicitor did not frame his reply immediately,
but a rush of blood to his complexion announced
what its nature would have been. The
fellow was really like a child in some things! How
could he suppose that these outworn pleas that
long ago had been worn threadbare by every
country attorney could carry the least weight with
men who bore sound heads on their shoulders?
If he had nothing better on which to base his defence
than the inadmissibility of circumstantial
evidence, there was no need for him to go into
court at all. He was declining to call the witnesses
who would attempt to prove insanity; he was rejecting
the one natural and reasonable line, which
had the sanction of those who were older, wiser,
altogether more capable than himself, in favor of
a single desperate throw with the dice—and here
was what that throw amounted to!</p>

<p>“I must venture to say,” protested the solicitor,
“you surprise one more and more. If you have
nothing more original than that to show the jury,
a weaker judge than Brudenell would demolish it
in a few minds like a house of cards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“We shall see.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear fellow, all the world knows
there is no escape from circumstantial evidence in
murder cases. Have you asked yourself the question
how many verdicts could have been taken in
recent years upon notorious crimes, had it been
ruled out?”</p>

<p>“I expect to have my own way of answering
the question,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Brudenell will have his.”</p>

<p>“Quite probably, I grant you,” said the young
man, with a tenacity that his companion felt to be
exasperating; “but unless one is wholly deceived
in the estimate of one’s own capacity—forgive
this very unprofessional candor in regard to oneself—the
jury will answer it in the fashion I ask
them to, not in the fashion asked of them by Mr.
Justice Brudenell and Mr. Horatio Weekes.”</p>

<p>“Well, my young friend,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
scrutinizing him with the patient wonder that is
bestowed on a rare quadruped in a zoological gardens,
“pray don’t think me impertinent if I confess
that you are the most baffling compound I
have ever encountered.”</p>

<p>“Notably,” said Northcote, “of self-conceit,
pig-headedness, childishness, ignorance, and effrontery.
I dare say you are right, for have I not
committed the unpardonable offence of assuming
that I am wiser than Tobin, wiser than yourself,
also of considering myself the superior of the
judge upon the bench?”</p>

<p>“You may be perfectly entitled to this self-estimate
after the event,” said the solicitor, with
a candor he was unable to repress; “but I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
like to say that only a very complete, and even
astonishing, success to-morrow can possibly justify
it.”</p>

<p>“I recognize, I concede that,” said the young
advocate, with an unexpected humility. He passed
his handkerchief across his dripping forehead. “Is
it not true of all who undertake to perform a miracle
that nothing short of a consummate achievement
will satisfy those eternally timid ones who
have not even the courage to be credulous? It is
the fate of all who break with custom to be derided,
but was anything ever done for the world
by conforming to it?”</p>

<p>“Custom is a useful safeguard against ridicule,
at any rate,” said Mr. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“Ridicule!” cried the young man. “Would
you have one fear it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son,” said the solicitor, with calmness
and unction, “one would have every professional
man fear it like the plague.”</p>

<p>“God knows we are all susceptible to the fear
of ridicule,” said the young man, sweating profusely,
“but is it not those fearful minds that
defer perpetually to custom that build their actions
upon it? Where would the epoch-makers have been
had they been weak enough to defer to ridicule?
No movement was ever initiated but what in the
beginning its progenitor was laughed out of
court.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand, my young friend,” said Mr.
Whitcomb in his suavest accent, “that you propose
to elevate the hanging of Emma Harrison
into a world movement?”</p>

<p>“You may,” said the young man, lifting up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
his chin, from which great beads were rolling,
“for the theme is fit for a world-drama. And he
who is cast for the leading rôle shall make it so.”
With unsteady steps Northcote passed out of the
gloomy corner in which he stood to where the daylight
struggled through the grated window. He
pressed his forehead against the bars. “One
would have preferred Gethsemane,” he muttered;
“at least there would have been space and air.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb readdressed himself to the study
of the <i>Law Journal</i>. The conquest of that irritation
which overcomes on occasion the sternest discipline
had long been elevated into a mental habit
by this sagacious gentleman, who felt it to be the
due of the inimitable coolness with which he looked
at life. Yet could he have indulged an explosion
without endangering his stupendous dignity, he
must have done so here. This ridiculous fellow
was getting on his nerves. Whatever could have
led him to entrust him with a case of this kind?
Was it not an evil hour when he climbed those
foul and dark stairs to hale him from the obscurity
of his garret? What could be clearer than that
this madman was about to make a public exhibition
of himself and of his client? After all, the unearthing
of this man Northcote was no more than
a whim of Tobin’s formed on the spur of the occasion.
Tobin, it was true, was highly successful,
yet he was himself a somewhat odd, whimsical fellow,
a Celt; and really his suggestion ought to
have been seen at the deuce. Yet it was no
good to repine; he had gone too far to draw back;
time, the tyrannical determining factor of every
event, allowed him no choice. This man Northcote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
must be Emma Harrison’s advocate or she
must do without one.</p>

<p>In the meantime Northcote’s tense emotion had
been well served by the cold iron against which his
face was pressed. It seemed to possess a medicinal
quality which entered his arteries. Once more his
mind was able to exert its faculty. His courage,
his fecundity of idea, the sense of his destiny, had
seemed to return.</p>

<p>The discomposure of the solicitor and the nervous
tension of the advocate were intruded upon
at last by the constable, who had taken rather more
than three-quarters of an hour to perform his mission.</p>

<p>“Will you come this way, gentlemen?” he said.</p>

<p>They were conducted along more dark and apparently
interminable passages, up one flight of
stone steps and down two others, until at last they
found themselves in a room similar to the one they
had left, except that it was larger and gloomier,
smelt rather more poisonous, and looked somewhat
more funereal.</p>

<p>Northcote’s heart was again beating violently
as he stepped over its threshold, and his excitement
was not in the least allayed when he discovered that
there was no one in it.</p>

<p>“If you will kindly take a seat, gentlemen,” said
their guide, “Harrison will be here in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“In other words, twenty,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
beginning a tour of inspection of this dismal apartment.
“These small mementoes may have some
slight interest for you, my friend,” he said to
Northcote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>He drew the young man’s attention to a row of
shelves placed at right angles to the window. They
were raised tier upon tier to the height of the ceiling,
and were crammed with crude staring objects.
A close inspection revealed them to be busts made
of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>“Why, what are these horrible things supposed
to represent?” said Northcote, with a thrill in
his voice.</p>

<p>“These,” said Mr. Whitcomb cheerfully, “are
the casts taken after death of a number of ladies
and gentlemen who have had the distinction of
being hanged within the precincts of this jail during
the past hundred years. If you will examine
them closely, you will be able to observe the indentation
of the hangman’s rope, which has been
duly imprinted on the throat of each individual.
Also, you may discern the mark of the knot under
the left ear. Interesting, are they not? The official
mind is generally able to exhibit itself in quite an
amiable light when it stoops to the æsthetic.”</p>

<p>“I call it perfectly devilish,” said Northcote,
shuddering with horror.</p>

<p>“They must have quite a peculiar scientific interest,”
said Mr. Whitcomb, “for each lady or
gentleman who may chance to enter this apartment
to consult his or her legal adviser. Are you able
to recognize any of these persons of distinction?
If I am not mistaken, the elderly gentleman on the
third row on the right towards the door is no less
an individual than Cuttell, who poisoned a whole
family at Wandsworth. High-minded and courteous
person as he undoubtedly was, I must say
Cuttell certainly looks less <i>outré</i> now he is dead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and more in harmony with his surroundings, than
when he entered this room, and asked me in a
mincing tone, with all the aitches misplaced,
whether in my opinion any obstacle would be raised
against his getting his evening clothes out of pawn,
as he desired to wear them in the dock during his
trial.”</p>

<p>“For the love of pity, spare me!” cried Northcote,
pressing his fingers into his ears, “or I shall
run away.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman with the protruding lip on the
second shelf towards the window is, unless my eyes
deceive me, one Bateman, who slaughtered his
maiden aunt with a chopper and buried her in a
drain—”</p>

<p>Northcote spared himself further details in the
history of Mr. Bateman by laying violent hands
upon his counterfeit presentment, and hurling it
with terrific force against the iron window bar,
whence it fell to the floor in a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>“Upon my soul, I have a great mind to go
through the lot,” he said, livid with fury.</p>

<p>“Pray do so, by all means, dear boy,” said Mr.
Whitcomb, with that unction which never forsook
him, “and you will find your art-loving countrymen
will avenge this outrage upon the private and peculiar
form of their culture by one day insisting that
your own effigy is placed on these historic shelves.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX<br>

<small>THE ACCUSED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Renewed</span> assaults upon these interesting <i>objets
d’art</i> were averted by sounds outside in the corridor.
Northcote imposed a superhuman control
on all his faculties that his agitation might be restrained,
when the door opened and two shadowy
figures, barely visible at first, crept silently into the
darkness of the room.</p>

<p>The two figures were those of women. By the
time Northcote had evoked a sufficient force of
will to meet their outline, the one that first encountered
his glance was so brutalized and repulsive
that his eyes were detained with a fascinated
sense of horror. It belonged to a creature that was
degraded, squat, coarse, insensitive. He felt almost
the same reluctance in approaching it as he would a
cobra.</p>

<p>She, however, was not the one whom Mr. Whitcomb,
with all the polished readiness of the thoroughgoing
man of the world, had advanced to
meet, and to whom he had held out his hand. The
young man heard with stupefaction, while his own
gaze remained riveted to the features of the sibyl,
the bland and courtier-like tones of the solicitor
caressing and paying homage to a figure in the
background, a figure which was still and silent,
which he could not see.</p>

<p>This person, however, had no interest for Northcote;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
she was so obviously the female warder who
had accompanied the murderess. One so characterless,
so formless, could not be said to exist in
the presence of this detaining horror, whose personality
thickened, as with pestilence, the noisome
air of the room. And it was this obscene life that
he had pledged himself to save!</p>

<p>Strangely, this blunt fact did not dominate his
consciousness in the manner it must have done one
of a less alert perception. For with a perversity
that transcended the will, at this moment his
thoughts were overspread by the comedy that was
being enacted by the suave lips of the solicitor.
The harmonious stream of mellow commonplaces
that Mr. Whitcomb was pouring into the ear of
the shrinking official nonentity who kept in the
background accosted his sense of the comic with
a kind of lugubrious irony. With a critical detachment
which even startled himself, he seemed to
awake to the fact that he was standing outside his
<i>milieu</i>, that he was witnessing a drama within a
drama; and he found himself in possession of the
singular reflection that here was a robust yet delicate
adumbration of the farcical which would make
the fortune of a writer for the stage. For there
was something indescribably ludicrous in the rich
voice of the solicitor enunciating his own private
opinions upon the weather, the state of trade, the
inconvenience of winter and its bearing upon the
perennial problem of the unemployed, when the
grotesque horror which dominated the room was at
his elbow, emitting the glances of a venomous
snake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Suddenly Northcote heard Mr. Whitcomb call
his name.</p>

<p>“Come here, Mr. Northcote; I want to introduce
you.”</p>

<p>In a hazy, stupefied manner the young man
obeyed.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harrison,” said the solicitor, “allow me
to present my friend Mr. Northcote. I feel sure
you will find a friend in him too.”</p>

<p>The advocate grew aware that a weak, nerveless
hand was resting in his, but his eyes were still
riveted on the face of the ghoul.</p>

<p>“Say something, you fool, and play up a bit,”
said the solicitor’s calm voice in his ear.</p>

<p>“Er—a nice day, Mrs. Harrison,” said the
young man, without knowing a word he was uttering.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a hesitating voice, which by no possibility
could have proceeded from the tightly
closed lips of the creature whom his gaze was devouring.</p>

<p>The words broke the illusion at a blow. The brutalized
countenance under whose dominion he had
fallen was that of the female warder. The person
with whom the solicitor had been conversing with
such cheerful volubility, to whom he was now himself
speaking, was the poisoner, the cold-blooded
denizen of the curb and the gutter. He drew his
hand away quickly, with an involuntary emotion,
from those hot, flabby, and damp fingers that he
still detained.</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” the woman seemed to
breathe, as though she were interpreting an unspoken
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“I may tell you, Mrs. Harrison,” said the solicitor,
with his well-fed chuckle, “that if your knowledge
can compare with that of this gentleman, you
are one of the wisest persons in the world. He
will tell you so himself.”</p>

<p>So crude a gibe had the happy effect of restoring
to Northcote his self-possession.</p>

<p>“My name is not known, Mrs. Harrison,” he
said, with his fibres stiffening, and his voice growing
deeper and falling under control, “but you can
trust me to eke out my inexperience with a determination
to serve you to the utmost of my power.”</p>

<p>Northcote saw that two luminous orbs were being
defined slowly in the centre of the gloom. For
an instant no reply was made to his words, and then
he was conscious that a faint voice was whispering,
“If your friend would go right away with the
warder—right away to the end of the room, then
perhaps we could speak with one another here
where it is so dark.”</p>

<p>“Whitcomb,” said Northcote, in a low tone,
“please take the warder right up to the window at
the other end, where you can see to read, and read
the <i>Law Journal</i> to her.”</p>

<p>“How d’ye do, ma’am,” said the solicitor, turning
to the ghoul in his promptest, blandest, and
most musical manner. “I think it has been my
privilege to meet you before, although you may not
remember me. Is that boy of yours prospering in
the police force?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got a boy in the police force,” said the
sibyl, in a loud, strident tone.</p>

<p>“Then which of your blood relations is it, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
I ask, who is connected with the police force? I
am sure you have some one.”</p>

<p>“I have an uncle.”</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure, an uncle! But it is so easy to
make a mistake on a point of official nepotism.
Come along this way, ma’am, and tell me all about
your uncle.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX<br>

<small>THE INTERVIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Prisoner</span> and advocate were left together amid
recesses of impenetrable gloom in the darkest corner
of the large apartment. It seemed to enfold
them, and to render the pallor of their faces almost
invisible. The eyes alone encountered those of
each other, and even these could embody no phase
of meaning. A strange continence, as sharp and
clean as that of a hero of fable, had begun to
cleanse the veins of the advocate. In the presence
of this stealthy thing his nature had never seemed
so fine, so valiant, so full of subtle penetration; nor
had it ever felt so girt with mastery, so completely
enamored of its own security.</p>

<p>“I shall know what words to speak to-morrow,”
he said, in a hoarse undertone.</p>

<p>“Will they not be spoken for yourself?” whispered
the dismal low voice.</p>

<p>“How? In what manner?”</p>

<p>“You will speak to make a name.”</p>

<p>“Also for the salvation of yours.”</p>

<p>“Mine does not matter; it is not my own.”</p>

<p>“You trust me, do you not?”</p>

<p>“I trust you; yet you drew your hand away so
quickly when you knew it was not the warder who
was the murderess. Give it to me again.”</p>

<p>There was something so curious in the prisoner’s
fragility, something so strange in her cowed air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
that it seemed to pervade the advocate with the
stealth of a drug. But the emotion of disgust with
which he had withdrawn his hand when first he
grew conscious that he touched her was no longer
present when he offered it again. The second time
she clasped her fingers round it so that their pressure
seemed to sear his skin. It had the heat of a
live coal.</p>

<p>In releasing his hand she let her fingers yield it
so imperceptibly that he did not know the precise
point at which it had ceased to be held; and he was
afraid to make a motion of withdrawal, lest it
should be interpreted as a repetition of that which
had dealt her a wound. He tried to see her face,
but in the darkness there was no lineament to decipher.</p>

<p>“This is my deliverer,” he heard her breathe.</p>

<p>“How have you come to know it?” The advocate
was devoured by an intolerable curiosity.</p>

<p>“Your hands—your hands, they are so powerful;
are you not so strong?”</p>

<p>There was nothing in these words that the advocate
had expected; the voice, the manner of their utterance,
their apparent irrelevance, made a strange
effect in his ears.</p>

<p>“They will not do me to death,” she said, in a
tone he could hardly hear. “I never tasted life
until I was brought into prison. And you cannot
think how sweet it is to me. Everything has become
so beautiful: the birds, the trees, and the sky,
and the crowds of people and the mud of the great
city.”</p>

<p>She clutched the hand of the young advocate
with a convulsive shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Your quietness tells me that you understand.”
Her voice was touched with ecstasy. “You do not
answer or seek to console me. You are the one I
have dreamed of in prison. Where is your
hand?”</p>

<p>Again Northcote yielded to her entreaty, this
time without a sense of repulsion.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the hand that has been around me
in the darkness, when I have shuddered in my
dreams.”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful,” said Northcote, “that you
should know that you will be able to lean upon me.”</p>

<p>“I know what your voice is like also, although
it is so vague and distant to me now. I know the
words it will speak to-morrow, when it asks them
to be merciful. I know that all I have seen in my
dreams will take place.”</p>

<p>“It must be a grievous thing to go to sleep in a
prison,” said Northcote, uttering a half-formed
thought without consideration of his words. “Or
perhaps it is more dreadful to awaken in one.”</p>

<p>“The going to sleep and the awakening are not
so terrible as the dreams that come. That in which
I saw you first, in which I first heard your voice,
in which I first touched the hand that will deliver
me, was most dreadful in its nature. My weak
mind fell down under it. I think I could not live
through such a vision again.”</p>

<p>“How strange are these visitations!” said
Northcote. “How awful, how mysterious! When
did this dream come to you?”</p>

<p>“Last night about the hour of ten; the first time
I had closed my eyes for three days.”</p>

<p>Northcote recoiled with a shudder. The precision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
of the voice and the power of the coincidence
were overmastering.</p>

<p>“There is no accounting for these things,” he
said, in a voice throbbing with excitement. “At
the same hour I also had a strange, an almost terrible
sort of vision.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my deliverer, you have been called into my
life to save it—to save that life which never had
a perfect thought until it was brought into prison.
It did not know what the trees and the sky were,
nor the air and the birds; never had it heard a
deep voice nor touched a strong hand. You are he
that leaped out of the vast multitude that mocked
me in my dream, he who stood up before it, and,
with a great voice that sounded like the waves of
the sea, caused them all to break and run. They
grew afraid of your words and your looks, and they
fled in terror. Yes, my life has become so full of
beauty and meaning, so full of a spacious mystery,
that I cannot believe it is to be taken away.”</p>

<p>These words, breathed rather than spoken,
sounded in the ear of Northcote as those of a transcendent
sanity. Remote as they were, they yet appeared
divinely appropriate to the time and place.
But they left only one course for him to follow.
He must detach himself from the unhappy speaker
of them; he must flee her presence. Their edge
was too keen. There would be no advocacy on the
morrow if he yielded to the subtle enervation of
this atmosphere. The voice pierced him like a
passion, yet his veins had grown sluggish and
heavy, as if under the influence of a drug.</p>

<small>THE TALISMAN WHICH TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Calling</span> the name of the solicitor, Northcote
broke away abruptly from the prisoner and left the
room. It had seemed to be charged with a pestilence.
Mr. Whitcomb was soon at his side, and
hastily they wended their way up and down various
flights of stone steps, along the noisome corridors
of the huge building, until daylight came in sight
once more through the doorway at the end of the
passage at which their cab was standing. Their
relief was very real at being able to breathe again
the living air, fog-laden as it was.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how many times,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
as they drove from the portals of the jail,
“on one errand and another, I have descended into
this inferno, but it never loses its power to give me
the blues.”</p>

<p>“I am regretting,” said Northcote, “that I did
not take your advice. I wish I had not come near
it. I cannot shake off the impression it has made.
Ugh! it gets into one’s blood. I don’t know anything
quite so overpowering as the nausea of
locality.”</p>

<p>“You are too impressionable, my son,” said the
solicitor, with a furtive smile. “You will never be
able to get through life at this rate. It wants one
of some hardihood, one who is robust in each one
of his five senses, to practise law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“I would say,” Northcote rejoined, with a shudder,
“that to be armed for this calling each particular
nerve he has got in his body must be shod
with iron.”</p>

<p>The solicitor laughed at so palpable a discomposure.</p>

<p>“What did you make of the prisoner?” he
asked, suddenly. “You appeared to find a great
deal to say to one another.”</p>

<p>“Personally I hardly spoke a word to her,” said
the young man, seeking to gather his recollection
of that strange interview.</p>

<p>“She appeared to find a good deal to say to
you,” said the solicitor. “In that respect you have
been more fortunate than myself. I have spoken
with her three times, and I don’t think I have
been able to extract three words from her. Do you
mind telling me what she said?”</p>

<p>“To the best of my remembrance she said nothing
that could have the least interest for anybody.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, what impression of her have you
brought away?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know whether she allowed me to form
one. Our communication seemed so indirect. She
kept her face in the shadow all the time; I could
not discern a feature.”</p>

<p>“Surely you were able to gather some sort of
general idea?”</p>

<p>“That is the strange thing—I seem to have
formed no opinion about her. One would not
have thought it conceivable that one should have
conversed with a person, dealt at least in an actual
exchange of words at close quarters, and that they
should remain so null. I think I should have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
better acquainted with her had I not seen her at
all.”</p>

<p>“Come, my dear fellow, you can surely recall
a word or two of what she said? She is an
enigma; and she is said not to have spoken six
words since she was first remanded in custody.”</p>

<p>“That certainly makes the volubility in which
she indulged this afternoon the more astonishing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it does. Would you say that she expects
an acquittal?”</p>

<p>“Well, now you come to mention that, I would
say she does.”</p>

<p>“It is an extraordinary thing that they are all
so sanguine. It hardly ever seems to occur to any of
them that by any possibility they can meet with
their deserts. Indeed, one might say the bigger the
criminal, the greater their confidence that they will
escape.”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you what opinion you have
formed of her,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“It follows the lines of your own. When I have
come into personal contact with her, I have been
able to make rather less than nothing of her. At
first I thought she seemed sullen, and quite reconciled
to her position, indeed, that she was too callous
to care about anything; but upon seeing her
to-day, I was rather struck by the fact that her
attitude had undergone a change.”</p>

<p>“How long has she been in prison?”</p>

<p>“Nearly three months. She is an odd sort of
creature—her former associates are agreed upon
that—and doubtless some sort of change has taken
place in her. I am more than ever convinced that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
insanity is your line; and by this time it should
not be too much to hope that you are.”</p>

<p>“She will expect her liberty.”</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> will expect! My dear boy, it is when you
permit yourself to talk in this fashion that you
fill one with so much distrust. Her position entitles
her to expect nothing.”</p>

<p>“No sort of doubt overtakes you then in regard
to her guilt?”</p>

<p>“None. I have suggested that to you over and
over again. My dear fellow, it is as I feared; you
have not permitted yourself a due appreciation of
the overwhelming nature of the evidence. I do
not see how she can hope to escape; and this is
pretty plain speaking on the part of her attorney.
Just look at the array of facts—her course of life,
her purchase of the poison, the result of the post-mortem,
the presence of motive. Again and again
I have felt it to be my duty to suggest to you that
Tobin would not have attempted to shake the evidence.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must permit me to say that, reflect
upon the question as I will, it does not seem easy
to reconcile the woman in that room with the cold-blooded
monster who will be presented to the jury.”</p>

<p>“That phenomenon is by no means rare. It has
been my fortune to undertake the defence of more
than one finished example of moral obliquity who
has presented not the least indication of such a condition.
Besides, do you not admit that the impression
that this woman made upon you was one
of absolute nullity? Were you not unable to divine
anything in regard to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was my first feeling; but I am now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
confessing that after all, in some mysterious way,
she has contrived to shake these preconceived ideas
about her, now that from this distance I can view
the room and what transpired in it. I dare not
say by what means she has contrived to produce
this effect; indeed, it is so subtle that I can hardly
say what it amounts to, because if I begin to recall
her words she seems almost to have admitted her
guilt. Yet of one thing I am convinced—she
presented no evidence of her depravity.”</p>

<p>“One can easily concede the probability of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but had it been as complete as you insist,
I must have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but I am afraid it does not follow.
What is easier than to hide its traces from
the eyes of inexperience?”</p>

<p>“Have I not the talisman in my pocket which
transcends experience?”</p>

<p>“Talisman be damned,” said Mr. Whitcomb,
with a jovial brutality.</p>

<p>Before his companion could frame an answer to
a scorn so unconciliatory, the hansom stopped before
the offices of Messrs. Whitcomb and Whitcomb.
They alighted together.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII<br>

<small>LIFE OR DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> final consultation of Northcote and his
client took place in the open street in the heavily
raining December afternoon, with their backs
against Mr. Whitcomb’s brass plate. The spot selected
for their last utterances on this momentous
affair was incongruous indeed, but each had grown
so impatient of the other, that if their last words
were spoken here, the clash of their mental states
was the less likely to invite disaster than in a more
formal council-chamber of four walls.</p>

<p>The robust common sense of the solicitor had
never shown itself to be more incisive than now
as he stood with his back to his own door, under
a dripping umbrella, his hat pushed to the back of
his head, and his trousers turned up beyond his
ankles. His twenty years of immensely successful
practice, his exact knowledge of human nature, his
ruthless worldliness, his reverence for the hard
fact, stood forth here in the oddest contrast with
the somewhat “special” and rarefied quality of
this youthful advocate whom he had seen fit to entrust
with so important a case.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity, it’s a pity,” he brought himself to say
at last, his veneer falling off a little under the stress
of his chagrin, and revealing a glimpse of the baffled
human animal beneath. “It is a serious mistake
to have made; but we have got to stand to it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
You are not the man for this class of work, to
speak bluntly. You are either too deep or you are
not deep enough. But as I say, we have got to
stand to it now. My last words will be to urge
you to put as good a face upon it as you can.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Northcote, stiffening,
“you will look to me to do my best.”</p>

<p>“I don’t put it in that form exactly,” said the
solicitor, midway between exasperation and a desire
to be courteous. “I want you fully to appreciate
that you are handling an extremely tough
job, and I merely want you to make the best of
it, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you, Mr. Whitcomb,” said Northcote,
striving in vain to avert the explosion that
had been gathering for so long, “that if it were
not now the eleventh hour, if I had not pledged
myself to this thing more deeply than you know,
if it were not a matter of life and death to me as
well as to your client, I would throw your brief
back at you rather than submit to this. It will
be time enough for you to get upon your platform
when I have made a hash of everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you are entitled to say that,” said
the solicitor impartially, having made a successful
effort to recapture his own serenity. “I have no
right to talk as I am doing; I have never done so
to any one else. I suspect you have got on my
nerves a bit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the whole matter throws back to the clash
of our temperaments,” said Northcote, unable to
cloak his own irritation now that it had walked
abroad. “It is a pity that we ever attempted to
work together. Yet for one who envelops himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
in the serene air of reason, you are somewhat illogical,
are you not? You enter the highways and
hedges in search of a particular talent; you have the
fortune to light upon it; and then you turn and
rend its unhappy possessor for possessing it.”</p>

<p>“As I say, my dear boy, this particular talent
of yours—or is it your temperament?—you see
I am not up in these technical names—has got on
my nerves a little.”</p>

<p>“And your temperament, my friend, to indulge
a <i>tu quoque</i>, is covered with a hard gritty outer coating,
for which I believe the technical name is
‘practicality,’ which positively sets one’s teeth on
edge.”</p>

<p>“So be it; we part with mutual recriminations.
But this is my last word. Firmly as I believe I
have committed an error of judgment, if to-morrow
you can prove that I have deceived myself,
you will not find me ungrateful. I can speak no
fairer; and this you must take for my apology.
It is not too much to say that since I have come
to know you I have ceased to recognize myself.”</p>

<p>“I accept your <i>amende</i>” said Northcote, without
hesitation. “I see I have worried you, but if
I might presume to address advice to the fount of
all experience, never, my dear Mr. Whitcomb, attempt
to formulate a judgment upon that which
you cannot possibly understand.”</p>

<p>“After to-morrow there is a remote chance that
I may come to heed your advice. In the meantime
we will shake hands just to show that malice is
not borne. Don’t forget that you will be the first
called to-morrow, at half-past ten. It is quite
likely to last all day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The solicitor turned into his offices and Northcote
sauntered along Chancery Lane. The twilight
which had enveloped the city all day was now
yielding to the authentic hues of evening. The
dismal street-lamps were already lit, the gusts of
rain, sleet, and snow of the previous night had
been turned into a heavy downpour which had
continued without intermission since the morning.
The pavements were bleached by the action
of water, but a miasma arose from the overburdened
sewers, whose contents flowed among the
traffic and were churned by its wheels into a paste
of black mud. Northcote was splashed freely with
this thick slushy mixture, even as high as his face,
by the countless omnibuses; and in crossing from
one pavement to another he had a narrow escape
from being knocked down by a covered van.</p>

<p>It was in no mood of courage that the young
man pushed his way to his lodgings through the
traffic and the elbowing crowds who thronged the
narrow streets. Even the mental picture that was
thrown before his eyes of this garret which had
already devoured his youth had the power to make
him feel colder than actually he was. Never had
he felt such a depression in all the long term of
his privation as now in wending his way towards
it laboriously, heavily, with slow-beating pulses.</p>

<p>He was sore, disappointed, angry; his pride was
wounded by the attitude of his client. His self-centred
habit caused him to take himself so much
for granted, that at first he could discern no reason
for this <i>volte-face</i>. In his view it was inconsiderate
to withhold the moral support of which at this
moment he stood so much in need. Truly the lot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
of obscurity was hard; its penalties were of a kind
to bring many a shudder to a proud and sensitive
nature. The patronizing insolence of one whom he
despised was beginning to fill him with a bootless
rage, yet in his present state how impotent he was
before it. He must suffer such things, and suffer
them gladly, until that hour dawned in which his
powers announced themselves.</p>

<p>That time was to-morrow—terrible, all-piercing,
yet entrancing thought! The measure of his
talent would then be proclaimed. Yet all in an instant,
like a lightning-flash shooting through darkness,
for the first time the true nature of his task
was revealed to him. Doubt took shape, sprang
into being. Its outline seemed to loom through
the dismal shadows cast by the lamps in the street.
Who and what was he, after all, in comparison
with a task of such immensity? With startling
and overwhelming force the solicitor’s meaning was
suddenly unfolded to him.</p>

<p>He took himself for granted no more. He must
be mad to have gone so far without having paused
to subject himself to the self-criticism that is so
salutary. How could he blame the solicitor whose
eminently practical mind had resented this inaccessibility
to the ordinary rules of prudence? Was
he not the veriest novice in his profession, without
credentials of any kind? And yet he arrogated
to himself the right to embark upon a line of conduct
that was in direct opposition to the promptings
of a mature judgment.</p>

<p>How could he have been so sure of this supreme
talent? It had never been brought to test. The
only measure of it was his scorn of others, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
scorn of the unsuccessful for those who have succeeded.
The passion with which it had endowed
him was nothing more, most probably, than a
monomania of egotism. How consummate was the
folly which could mistake the will for the deed,
the vaulting ambition for the thing itself!</p>

<p>On the few occasions, some seven or eight in all,
in which he had turned an honest guinea, mostly
at the police-court, he had betrayed no surprising
aptitude for his profession. There had been times,
even in affairs so trivial, when his highly strung
nervous organization had overpowered the will.
He had not been exempt from the commission of
errors; he recalled with horror that once or twice
it had fallen to his lot to be put out of countenance
by his adversary; while once at least he had
drawn down upon himself the animadversions of
the presiding deity. Surely there was nothing in
this rather pitiful career to provide a motive for
this overweening arrogance.</p>

<p>He grew the more amazed at his own hardihood
as he walked along. To what fatal blindness did
he owe it that from the beginning his true position
had not been revealed to him? Where were the
credentials that fitted him to undertake a task so
stupendous? What achievement had he to his name
that he should venture to launch his criticisms
against those who had been through the fray and
had emerged victorious? How could he have
failed to appreciate that abstract theory was never
able to withstand the impact of experience! It
was well enough in the privacy of his garret to
conceive ideas and to sustain his faculties with
dreams of a future that could never be, but once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
in the arena, when the open-mouthed lion of the
actual lay in his path, he would require arms more
puissant than these.</p>

<p>To overcome those twin dragons Tradition and
Precedent, behind which common and vulgar minds
entrenched themselves so fearlessly, the sword of
the sophist would not avail. It would snap in his
fingers at the first contact with these impenetrable
hides. His blade must be forged of thrice-welded
steel if he were to have a chance on the morrow.
He had decided to promulgate like a second Napoleon
the doctrine of force, and for his only
weapon he had chosen a dagger of lath. Well
might Mr. Whitcomb smile with contempt. Where
would he find himself if he dared to preach the
most perilous of gospels, if he could not support
it with an enormous moral and physical power?</p>

<p>For years he had dwelt in a castle which he had
built out of air, secure in the belief that he was endowed
in ample measure with attributes whose
operations were so diverse yet so comprehensive,
that in those rare instances in which they were
united they became superhuman in their reach. An
Isaiah or a Cromwell did not visit the world once
in an era. How dare such a one as he fold his
nakedness in the sacred mantle of the gods! It
was the act of one whose folly was too rank even
to allow him to pose as a charlatan. If he ventured
to deliver one-half of these astonishing words
he had prepared for the delectation of an honest
British jury, these flatulent pretensions would be
unveiled, he would be mocked openly, his ruin
would be complete and irretrievable.</p>

<p>Never had irresolution assailed him so powerfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
This review at the eleventh hour of the unwarrantable
estimate he had formed of himself
rendered it imperative that he should change his
plans. The opinion of others, acknowledged masters
of the profession in which he was so humble
a tyro, was incontrovertible. Evidence in support
of a perfectly rational plea was provided for him,
would be ready in court. His client had demanded
that it should be used. To disregard that demand
would be to rebuff his only friend, one of great
influence who had been sent to his aid in his direst
hour. And it was for nothing better than a whim
that he was prepared to yield his all. No principle
was at stake, no sacrifice of dignity was involved.
That which his patron had asked of him was so
natural, so admirably humane, that the mere act
of refusal would be rendered unpardonable unless
it were vindicated by complete success. No other
justification was possible, not only in the eyes of
himself and in those of his client, but no less was
exacted of him by the hapless creature whose life
was in his keeping.</p>

<p>Stating it baldly, let him fail in the superhuman
feat which had been imposed upon him by a disease
which he called ambition, and this wretched woman
would expiate his failure upon the gallows. Had
any human being a right to incur such a penalty,
a right to pay such a price in the pursuit of his
own personal and private aims? The middle course
was provided for him. It would deliver the accused
and himself from this intolerable peril; it
opened up a path of safety for them both.</p>

<p>Already he could observe with a scarifying clearness,
that here and now, at the eleventh hour, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
must defer to the irresistible impact of the circumstances.
The risk was too grave; he was thrusting
too cruel a responsibility upon his flesh and blood.
He must hasten to make terms with that grossly
material world of the hard fact which he scorned
so much. He must submit to one of those pitiful
compromises which he yearned to defy; and in
so doing he must betray a talent which had inflicted
indescribable torments upon him.</p>

<p>His address to the jury of his countrymen, that
surprising impromptu prepared at leisure, must be
given up. Not a word could be used of this demand
for an acquittal which was to mark an epoch in
English justice. He must begin again on a lower
note.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the archway through which
he had to pass to reach his own door, he turned
into a post-office, and despatched to his mother
two sovereigns out of the ten he had received from
the solicitor. Enclosing a scrap of paper with the
order, he wrote these words upon it: “My first
great case is called to-morrow. Life or death for
Prisoner and Advocate—which?” Having posted
the letter he ascended the stairs to his garret.</p>

<p>He groped his way up to it. Shuddering with
despair he unlocked the door and flung it open. An
impenetrable darkness covered the room. He stood
on the threshold searching his damp clothes for a
match. He found a solitary one sequestered in a
corner of a pocket; but all attempts to strike it
failed. He then proceeded to grope his way forward
through the room, reached the table, and after
knocking down several articles was able to place his
hand upon that which he sought. He kindled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
light, and the lamp having been replenished with
oil that morning was able to maintain it. The fire
had burned out long ago; all the coal had been
used, and the fresh quantity he had purchased had
not arrived. His overcoat was soaked with rain,
his trousers were damp, and the room had already
become cold. He rummaged out an old sweater
that had stood him in good stead in his football
days, from a box beneath the bed, removed his wet
overcoat and pulled this garment over his jacket.
He then filled his pipe and sat down beside the
lamp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br>

<small>PREPARATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had taken his new resolve outside in the rain;
and it behoved him now to utilize these few remaining
hours in putting it into shape. Rejecting the
demand for the liberty of this wretched woman
he must consent to the verdict being given against
her, and place his hope in the clemency of the court.</p>

<p>For two inexpressibly weary hours he strove
with clenched lips to piece together and elaborate
this new line; but in spite of all his efforts it was
so dull and lifeless that the task seemed beyond him.
Whatever talent he possessed it was only too clear
that so vacillating a method of defence was quite
out of harmony with its workings. This way and
that he twisted each listless uninspired suggestion,
but at each laborious attempt it grew less possible
to breathe upon their dry bones and create them
into living flesh. These maimed and halting emendations
were as far removed from the swift and
audacious repleteness of the original as to express
the difference between light and dark.</p>

<p>It was the difference between life and death. The
one was informed with the living breath, a vital
and a surprising piece of art; the other was cold
and heavy, a confection of wormwood and ditch-water.
A bitter chagrin overcame him when he
saw all that his resolve implied. He would be sent
into court dumb, tongue-tied—he with a philippic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
against injustice packed away at the back of his
brain. This would mark the end of the ambition
that had nourished the fires of his heart through
full many a weary winter’s day.</p>

<p>The new words would not glow; they were so
much sound without meaning. Yet the new words
were the true words. They embodied the actual;
they stood for the established fact in its impartial
fearlessness; they were the servants of justice.
That the accused had committed the crime was clear
to the meanest intelligence. It only remained for
her advocate to announce her guilt and to pray for
mercy. Yet the phrases in which he shaped this
bald proposition crept to his lips as false, devious,
and dishonorable.</p>

<p>The old words conceived in sophistry were burning
things, brilliant with the blood and flame of
their emotion. Beneath them paradox itself stood
forth as but a subtler knowledge. The accent of
conviction made these words resonant, these words
whose design was to pervert and mislead. They
were breaking in constantly upon the dull and tortured
phrases which he was striving to weave, the
insensitive phrases whose function it was to embody
immaculate truth. The commonest platitudes were
not so stale as these. At last with a cry of rage
he spurned them vehemently from his mind.</p>

<p>Indeed, the only purpose that was served by these
endeavors was to prove to the unhappy advocate
that his nature must be allowed to obey its instincts.
He must fulfil his destiny. To that acute intelligence
it had come to seem that truth and untruth
were identical. It would seem to be born for iconoclasm,
for demolition; let it leave to less sophisticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
minds the championship of outworn ideas.
In this whirlpool of doubt in which he was engulfed,
his ideals, his instincts, all those mental
resources which garnish with dignity the most protean
character, seemed to break from their moorings;
and in the very frenzy of this wreck of his
stability, there returned upon him in the guise of
one of those paradoxes which had become so fatal,
a newer, a franker, a more vital conception of his
power.</p>

<p>There returned in its train the arrogance of his
quality. It was not for one of the blood royal to
submit to dictation from the mediocrity it despised.
Its right was inalienable to obey the forces within
itself. He had felt from the first that it was in
his power to save this woman; the attorney’s
doubts had intervened and for a time had overthrown
his faith; but now he had come to believe
it again. The thing called “experience,” that eternal
standby of the vulgar, was a mere tawdry substitute
for intuition in the inferior orders. A great
talent incorporated experience within itself. He
must suffer no qualm on the score of his youth,
his absence of laurels. After all, this brief had been
evoked by the exercise of an imperious will in a
magic hour; had he not an immemorial right to
use it as he chose? Let him obey the divine faculty
that had carried him so far, and then if fail
he must, at least his failure would be worthy of
himself. It was proper for common minds, destitute
of all force and originality, to subscribe to the
conventions which they set up to protect themselves.
Custom, usage, the accretions of centuries may even
hallow and exalt them until they assume the guise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of religions, but these simulations have nothing to
say to the royal among their kind.</p>

<p>This powerful impulse, whose impact upon the
mind of the advocate was almost terrible, merged
the surroundings in itself. Time and place were
obliterated; the evening was imperceptibly eaten
away. The clocks of the neighborhood gave out
the hour of midnight just as Northcote, gasping,
with all the breath driven out of his body, emerged
from the vortex to grasp his final decision. For
six hours he had not been sufficiently accessible to
the external to heed the hours as they struck. But
now, as the long-drawn strokes announced a new
day, a thrill of excitement convulsed his being.
The day of all days was at hand. He was standing
on the very threshold of the issue. The dread
future was about to roll back its veil. Such an
emotion was cast upon him that he began to tremble
as violently as when he had driven with Mr.
Whitcomb to the prison.</p>

<p>He supposed that the chime of these clocks would
penetrate the walls behind which the unhappy
woman was lying awake. She also must be trembling
violently. Doubtless the poisoner and prostitute
was dreaming again of her deliverer. The
idea overcame him with a curious poignancy which,
horrible as it was, was yet touched with ecstasy.</p>

<p>This was a creature who must expect no mercy
from the Pharisee; yet the living woman had a
power within herself to arouse a desire for it in
one who pretended to no exalted sympathy with
his species. In their interview in the prison he had
discerned nothing of vileness about her. And he
was fain to believe that she had dreamed in sober<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
verity of her advocate the previous night. Conjuring
up this memorable interview, which yet remained
so colorless that it seemed to have happened
only to the soul, the haunting low tones began to
speak through the silence of his room; and with
an impulse of joy that banished the horror of their
insistency he responded to the accents of their
truth.</p>

<p>A living voice had entered the room. It was
the same voice, and yet so much more resonant
than the one he had heard in the prison. The
senses of the advocate were strung to a point so
perilous that the luminous figure of a woman appeared
before them. This was she who had huddled
away into the shadows of the jail. The lamp
on the table, which with so much difficulty melted
the gloom within the area of its influence, framed
her contour with a kind of weird delicacy. Her
figure was veiled in a soft plasticity; it was that
of one who was in despair; yet it had all the simple
trust of her sex, which it exhibits at those supreme
moments when nothing is left to it save to kneel
and to embrace its faith. It was a figure such as
this that rolled away the stone from the mouth of
the cave and discovered that the body of Jesus was
not there.</p>

<p>During the interview the young advocate had
known and understood little, but now, under the
spell of his passion, an ampler knowledge enfolded
him in its mantle. It is not until we look down
upon them from the altitude of some momentous
phase, that those moments which are destined to assume
a permanence in our lives become crystallized
into our mental history. The terror and the reticence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
of this pitiable creature had pierced him like
a sword, yet it was not until this remote hour that
Northcote understood the miracle they had wrought
in his nature.</p>

<p>She must once have been fair under the eyes of
the sun; once slender, gracious, inhabited by chastity.
Her voice proclaimed a history that must
have been inexpressibly grievous. Yet the desire
for life was in her still. She was not prepared to
yield her interest in the mystery. Her words were
memorable: she had never understood anything
until she was brought into prison. Was it not meet
that this daughter of a hundred inhumanities should
now call to be released from the doom her fellows
had prepared for her. “I know you will save me,
my deliverer,” were the words he still heard; and
they came upon his ear with more of authenticity
than when they first fell from those indescribable
lips.</p>

<p>He rose from the chair in which he had been
immersed so many hours. He was shuddering in
every vein. His fingers and limbs were petrified
with the coldness of the room; his damp trousers
were inflicting his ankles with rheumatic pains.
So stiff were his limbs through remaining in one
position for so long, that it cost him labor to cross
the room and open the window.</p>

<p>He thrust out his head and a rush of icy air
saluted his temples. The rain had ceased; the
clouds had dispersed; the heavens, charged with
a keen frost, were studded thickly with little dark
blue stars. Peering towards them eagerly Northcote
tried to decipher the names and positions of
these meaningless heads, until at last he came upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
one which was larger and brighter than the rest.
He was convinced that its locality would render
it plainly visible from the windows of the prison.
He fixed his gaze upon it with great intensity; he
knew the occupant of the prison had climbed up
to peer at it through the bars of her cell.</p>

<p>Although he had spent the previous night without
entering a bed, nothing would have enabled his
thoughts to seek sanctuary in sleep. The incandescent
fervor of his mind would not allow him
to repose; and although a few hours hence he
would have to draw upon every spark of physical
energy he possessed, he had no fear of his bodily
limitations. He had the immense vitality of those
demigods among their kind, for whom no ascent
is too precipitous. He spent some time in vigorous
gymnastic exercises to drive the congealed blood
through his veins; and this accomplished, he felt
his strength return.</p>

<p>He passed the remaining portion of the night in
pacing his room, with a pipe fixed in his teeth and
his hands thrust beneath his white jersey into the
pockets of his trousers. Occasionally he ceased
these peregrinations for a few minutes at a time,
in order to write down some of the sentences as
they took shape in his mind. He desired to give
himself the æsthetic pleasure of seeing how they
looked on paper. Yet he did not propose to bestow
a literal preparation on this address, since he had
sufficient confidence in his fecundity of expression
to speak extempore and yet expect adequately to
traverse the scheme he had planned. Words
charged with emotion springing fresh and tingling
from the mist would increase their appeal by being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
thrown off in the actual impulse by which they
were created.</p>

<p>When at last the old charwoman arrived at half-past
seven she was astonished to discover Northcote
walking about the room looking wild and
haggard and declaiming passages of the peroration.
He sent her out to borrow some coal; and when
she returned with it and proceeded to make a fire,
he ordered as on the previous day what they both
considered to be a sumptuous breakfast. While
this was preparing he retired to fit himself for that
ordeal to which he would so soon be called.</p>

<p>Even now, however, a palsy was on his limbs,
a fever in his blood. In the delicate operation of
shaving he was unable to conduct the razor firmly,
and cut his chin repeatedly. It was with infinite
difficulty that he could render himself presentable
after the various gashes it had undergone. After
expending not less than an hour on his toilet, and
conferring as much respectability upon his person
as lies within the province of soap and water and
clean linen, he sat down at the table hungry and
cold yet consumed with excitement.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown,” he said to the old woman, “I
forgot to ask about that small grandchild of
yours.”</p>

<p>“She is dead, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry. When did this occur?”</p>

<p>“Last night, sir, about twelve. It is one mouth
less to feed, as you might say, but I think it might
have been my own.”</p>

<p>“But then there would have been no means of
feeding the others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it was a wrong expression,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
old woman in her precise manner. “It was not
what I meant to have said.”</p>

<p>“Well, come now,” said Northcote, “suppose
you try to eat some breakfast.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV<br>

<small>THE TRIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old woman took her seat at the table obediently,
but with a bewilderment as great as on the
previous day. It was very strange that incidents
such as these should arise to embellish her servitude.</p>

<p>This morning, however, she was not tormented
with a string of questions. Northcote was silent,
gloomy, and haggard; something appeared to be
preying on his mind. The remorse he had shown
for having failed to ask how her grandchild was
seemed strange to her indeed, for until the previous
day he had always stood in her mind as a member
of the inaccessible classes. Something had appeared
to happen to him by which, in a few short
hours, the tenor and current of his life had been
changed. There was a terrible excitement burning
now under his pale skin; his eyes were restless,
his fingers were twitching, and he drank cup after
cup of the hot tea as though he were consumed
with an intolerable thirst.</p>

<p>When he had finished his breakfast he took his
wig and gown out of a cupboard, and placed them
together with his brief in a small black bag. He
was on the point of starting for the court, when
through the open door he could hear footsteps on
the stairs. Some one was coming up to the fourth
story, an incident so rare in the experience of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
occupant as always to be rendered memorable. In
an instant the jovial outline of the solicitor presented
itself to his imagination. With an agitation
that was indescribable he foresaw that he was not
to be allowed to take the brief into court after
all.</p>

<p>Instead of Mr. Whitcomb, however, his visitor
proved to be a boy with a telegram. He tore it
out of its envelope. The contents were contained
in three words: “Life, my son.” They were from
his mother.</p>

<p>With this omen in his heart he set forth. A
welcome change had taken place in the weather.
The air had become sharp and dry; already misty
beams were stealing out from the December sun.
The press in the streets was immense, but he
brushed through it with the elevating consciousness
that he was overcoming a real obstacle. In
his every fibre was the breath of contest, the joy
of battle. His mother’s words, the faint beams
of the new day, the rattle of the traffic, all conspired
to endow him with a ruthless determination.</p>

<p>If it was to be that defeat and confusion should
overtake him, at least he would not go out to greet
them half-way. Once and for all he had put off
those fears and misgivings that had tormented him.
A great commander storming an inaccessible position
does not pause to estimate the cost; he does
not pause to contemplate the inevitability of disaster.
He, too, would show himself of this quality:
a great commander of his lurid and revolted imagination
in the teeth of frightful odds.</p>

<p>He arrived at the Old Bailey at a quarter-past
ten. He did not allow himself to glance at its profile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
nor did he permit his mind to be distracted by
one of the thousand details, common, depressing,
and of no significance in themselves, yet likely to
be so ominous in their effect on high-strung nerves.
He passed from the barristers’ robing-room as soon
as he could, for beyond everything he wished to
avoid contact with his kind. Yet to the majority
of those within its precincts he was not even known
by name; and he felt himself to be looked on
askance by all as a solitary, queer-headed fellow.</p>

<p>On entering the court he used great care in selecting
his seat. It was in a situation from which he
felt he could command the attention of all present;
from which the jury would lose nothing of what
he presented to it, and yet be sufficiently removed
to be unable to discern the more intimate workings
of his personality. Oratory like music demands a
certain space and distance in which and at which
to reveal itself. Before taking his seat he looked
all around him into every part of the building, in
order that he might familiarize himself with that
which lay about him. Every seat allotted to the
public was already in its occupation; the nature of
the charge was itself sufficient to stimulate its curiosity
in the highest degree. Among the members
of the bar the interest was not so great. There
was said to be no defence worthy of the name;
the crime was of a common kind, presenting neither
rare nor curious features; the absence of Tobin,
the most brilliant common law advocate among the
younger men, had become known; and the case
was expected to be disposed of without difficulty.
Its main interest in the eyes of the junior bar centred
around the man who had been asked to conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the defence. That one so obscure as Northcote
should have been chosen to fill the place of Tobin
in a murder case was one of those unexpected things
which furnished a theme for the critic’s function;
a function which the majority of those in their
robes on the benches felt eminently qualified to
undertake.</p>

<p>Many were surprised, some were a little grieved,
and the ambitious were rather disconcerted that
Northcote should be entrusted with a brief of this
nature. Obscure as he was in practice, he had acquired
a kind of reputation at the bar mess as one
who was singularly unsocial in his habits. As the
brief in the first instance had been marked with
a figure large enough to command the services of
Tobin, the defence could not be wholly destitute
of means. It was strange that a firm so notoriously
astute as Whitcomb and Whitcomb should have
handed it to one of no experience when the extremely
able counsel they had retained originally
had been compelled to throw up the case. There
was quite a number assembled in that court who
were far more competent to deal with it than this
young and unknown practitioner. In the opinion of
many, this circumstance was taken as the clearest
indication of all that the case had no life in it.</p>

<p>Hardly had Northcote taken his seat in the court
when he felt a hand on his shoulder; it belonged
to Mr. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“No nonsense, now,” he said anxiously. “The
witnesses are here, and we shall expect you to call
them.”</p>

<p>“It is quite impossible for me to alter my line
at the last moment,” said Northcote, while every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
nerve he had in his body seemed to be ticking furiously.
“Besides,” he added, in a hoarse whisper,
“don’t you see that if they are not called I shall
get the last word with the jury, as the attorney is
not in the case?”</p>

<p>“Pray, what is the use of that? What will that
do for you?”</p>

<p>“You must wait and see,” said the young man,
with a red haze before his eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I must insist on your calling
the witnesses.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible,” said the young man, in a
voice the solicitor could hardly hear.</p>

<p>“Really, you know, this is carrying things too
far.”</p>

<p>“I would to God,” exclaimed the young advocate,
with his voice breaking in the middle in the
queerest manner, “you had never retained me at
all!”</p>

<p>This outburst of petulance conferred upon the
solicitor a renewed sense of the young man’s situation.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he rejoined, with a certain kindness,
“I suppose you must do as you please. A case
is not over until a verdict’s brought in. But the
witnesses are here—if you change mind.”</p>

<p>The young advocate turned his haggard face and
bloodshot eyes upon his monitor, but his rejoinder,
whatever its nature, was banished from his lips by
the entrance of the judge. Almost in the same
instant the prisoner was put up. She was called
upon at once to plead to the indictment, “for that
she was accused of the wilful murder of Thomas
Henry Barron upon the 12th of September.” In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
a voice that was scarcely audible she pleaded, “I
am not guilty.”</p>

<p>The jury was sworn immediately, and justice
proceeded on its course with considerable expedition.
The case presented no feature that was warranted
to arrest the progress of the legal mind.
The woman’s guilt was indisputable; it was known
that the defence had nothing material to advance;
and even had it been placed more fortunately, it
was unlikely to be marshalled to advantage in its
present hands. The judge and the counsel for the
Treasury were at one in their eagerness to press
the opportunity of getting the case through, since
every few minutes they could rest from the course
of the public business was inexpressibly dear to
their hearts. They would be able to get off to a
week-end in the country by an earlier train.</p>

<p>Mr. Weekes, K. C., who led for the Treasury,
commenced briskly and volubly without the delay
of a moment. He was a small, thin man, with very
straight and attenuated hair, sandy in color, and
a pair of side-whiskers. A pair of gold pince-nez
suspended by a cord contrived by some means to
add to the quickness and irascibility of his frequent
gestures. His voice was keen and piercing and
somewhat metallic in sound; his language had
great facility but no distinction; his delivery was
rapid; but manner, diction, appearance, were equally
destitute of style.</p>

<p>In opening the case to the jury, this expert occupied
less than an hour. He unfolded the nature
of the charge in easy, fluent, almost deprecating
terms. It amounted to this: the accused, whose
reticence in regard to her antecedents was impenetrable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
and whose age appeared on the charge-sheet
as thirty-nine, had for several years past cohabited
with the deceased, who had followed the profession
of a book-maker.</p>

<p>It was known that previous to this she had lived
the life of the streets. It would be shown by several
of her associates, who would be called in evidence—women
like herself of ill-fame—that
during the last year in which she had lived with
this man, she had more than once been heard to
express the determination “to do for him.” It
would appear that the man, although said to treat
her well enough at first, had latterly evinced signs
of growing tired of her. Further, he was a man
of intemperate habits, and on many occasions she
had been heard to complain with bitterness of his
violence and brutality towards her.</p>

<p>The accused had been aware that by the man’s
will a sum of money had been left to her. She had
often, when in drink particularly, to which she also
was addicted, mentioned this fact boastfully to her
associates; and a few days prior to the commission
of the crime had asserted in the presence of three
of them, “that if she did not mind what she was
about she would lose it, as he was always threatening
to leave her.”</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the tenth of September she
purchased a quantity of vegetable poison of a chemist.
On the evening of the eleventh the man sat
up drinking heavily into the small hours of the
morning; and at noon on the twelfth he expired
in the presence of a doctor, who had been fetched
by a maid servant, although the woman herself
had done her best to prevent a doctor from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
summoned. In the doctor’s opinion the symptoms
pointed to death by poisoning. A post-mortem
was held the same afternoon; as the result of it
the woman was taken into custody, the house was
searched, and a quantity of strychnine was found
concealed in her bedroom. Subsequently the contents
of the man’s stomach was submitted to a public
analyst; and in his evidence he would testify
to the presence of strychnine in sufficient quantities
to cause death.</p>

<p>This was the case for the Crown. Evidence was
called in corroboration; first the detective who had
taken the woman into custody, and another who
had discovered the poison. These were examined
briefly by Mr. Topott, the junior counsel for the
Treasury. The doctors then described the cause of
death and the result of the post-mortem; and these
were confirmed in their opinion by the analyst when
he came to describe the result of his researches.
All of these were soon disposed of, as Northcote
did not attempt a word in cross-examination.</p>

<p>Two of the members of the junior bar, young
men and critical, who were not disinclined to see
a personal affront in Northcote’s preferment, were
not slow to note his passiveness, and to add it to
the estimate they had already formed of his incapacity.</p>

<p>“I never saw a fellow look in such a funk,” said
the first of these gentlemen, one who had been nurtured
in an atmosphere of wealth and influence, and
himself a former president of the Oxford Union.
“The case will be over by lunch.”</p>

<p>“They are not wasting much time, certainly,”
said his friend, the son of the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Two maid servants were called in evidence, and
examined by Mr. Topott with the same convincing
brevity as the previous witnesses. Here again
Northcote refrained from cross-examination.</p>

<p>“Ought to do something,” whispered the ex-president
in the ear of his friend. “Missing opportunities.
Why don’t he ask if she saw it administered?”</p>

<p>The chemist’s assistant who had supplied the
poison, and who had identified the portion found
in the possession of the accused as part of that
which had been sold to her, also escaped without a
challenge. Five of her female associates were then
called one after another. Their evidence was extremely
damning. With the skilled aid of the
junior counsel for the Crown, every rag of decency
was stripped from the woman in the dock. She
stood forth a veritable harpy and monster, several
shades more infamous than themselves. As one
after another of these witnesses was permitted to
stand down without being subjected to the ordeal
of cross-examination, the ex-president of the Oxford
Union was moved to express his personal disappointment.</p>

<p>“Something might have been done with these,
at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said his friend; “but
what’s the good, after all. It is a waste of time to
say anything.”</p>

<p>“There is no defence, I am told.”</p>

<p>“He will call evidence to show that she was subject
to violent fits of passion when in drink.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is where Tobin will be missed. Really,
one is surprised at Whitcomb and Whitcomb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“They saw the futility of fighting, and are doing
it on the cheap.”</p>

<p>“Poor brute! But I don’t altogether agree with
you. Something might have been done by a man
of ability. I should like to have seen Tobin in
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Tobin would have attempted to
touch their witnesses. We must wait till he calls
his own to see what he is worth.”</p>

<p>At this moment, however, those who had conducted
this secret conversation had their curiosity
gratified by the spectacle of Northcote rising for
the first time. He got up heavily and wearily, as
though age had stricken him in every joint. His
face was almost painful in its pallor. The last
“unfortunate” had just made her half-audible reply
to the final question that had been put to her
by the amiable Mr. Topott.</p>

<p>“I believe you said you had been acquainted ten
years with the accused?” said Northcote, in a voice
that was curiously low and gentle.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“During that period you had known her many
times to be under the influence of drink?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Would you say that drink excited her easily?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That a very small quantity was sufficient to excite
her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And that when in this condition she was inclined
to be very free in her speech?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Also she had a tendency to make use of expressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
that she was never known to permit herself
when perfectly sober?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The same would apply to her statements when
in this excited condition?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“They were obvious exaggerations?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And some were pure inventions? You knew
they were wholly untrue?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You and her other friends were well acquainted
with her habit of giving way to exaggeration, and
even to palpable untruth when under the influence
of drink?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The habit was so well known that it was amusing
to you? You have often laughed about it
among yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You were known to say yourself on one occasion
when she was what you call particularly
‘merry,’ ‘Emma would do for anybody on a quartern
of gin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You have a distinct recollection of saying
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your meaning was that when your friend had
had that quantity of alcohol the airs of bravado
she assumed were quite ridiculously out of keeping
with her character?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And the point of your saying lay in the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
that whether your friend had had drink or whether
she had not, her character was so soft and gentle
that you could not conceive her to be capable of
hurting anybody?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“She has been your friend for ten years?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Throughout that period you have found her
to be generous, kind, impulsive, lovable?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“No one’s enemy save her own?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Had it ever seemed possible to you that if she
was capable of the commission of this atrocious
crime of which she stands accused, she could never
have enjoyed the ten years of your friendship, nor
the ten years of affection you lavished on her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“It was no wish of your own that brought you
to this court?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you cannot say you came here of your
own free will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You were brought here under compulsion?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Without that compulsion nothing would have
induced you to come here, and stand in this box,
and speak words which might be used to hurt your
friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The witness had been weeping softly for some
time. Her emotion, which in the circumstances was
natural, was also felt to be a tribute to the examining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
counsel. The gentleness of a voice which
touched the chord of pathos in every phrase it uttered
without betraying a consciousness that it did
so, invested a series of tame and unfruitful questions
with an æsthetic quality which even the least
educated of those present could appreciate.</p>

<p>At this point, however, Mr. Weekes rose
brusquely and tartly with an objection. His friend
had trespassed beyond the privilege of counsel.
The objection was upheld by the judge, who with
a kind of courteous acerbity informed Northcote
in some very harmonious diction that he would do
well to put his question in another form.</p>

<p>“I will do so, my lord,” said the young man,
with admirable composure and raising his voice a
little.</p>

<p>“You were forced to come here by the police?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“In whom you stand in great fear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are compelled to do all that they require
of you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And when they take one of your friends to
prison, and they come to you and suggest words
that she may have used to you when she was not
in a condition to weigh them, you know very well
that whatever your own feeling is in the matter,
you must say nothing, and you must do nothing
that is likely to displease the police?”</p>

<p>A more emphatic protest was entered at this point
by the counsel for the Crown. It was upheld by
the judge with an equal access of emphasis. Northcote
accepted the ruling with the nicely poised urbanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
with which he had received the previous one;
yet in the act of doing so he contrived, as if by an
accident, to let his gaunt eyes alight on the jury. It
was followed by a smile which crept over his haggard
cheeks; and this was conveyed to each of
them personally, as though he were covering a retreat
with a little apology. Yet it was all contrived
so delicately that it required a certain fineness of
perception to notice it.</p>

<p>During the next few minutes these objections
were frequent. They were raised with an ever-increasing
vehemence by the counsel for the Crown,
were embodied with an ever-increasing acerbity and
sternness by the judge, and were received by the
counsel for the defence with a deferential patience,
the ironical side of which was immediately exposed
by the next question he put to the witness, and also
by the concentrated manner in which he smiled at
the jury. After a perfect rain of objections, which
for the purposes of our narrative must henceforward
be taken as granted, the leader for the Crown
could stand the carefully elaborated audacity of
this unknown tyro no longer. He lost his temper.</p>

<p>“Mr.—er—er,” he said, referring to a paper
for the name, “Mr. Thornton, you have no need to
keep smiling at the jury in that way.”</p>

<p>Northcote turned to face his adversary with a deliberation
that astonished the bar, and even caused
a grim flicker to play about the mouth of the
judge.</p>

<p>“I trust, Mr. Weekes,” he said, “you will withdraw
your objection to these amenities. If you do
not, I feel sure his lordship will be bound to uphold
it. And if, Mr. Weekes, I might urge you to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
patient, I can promise that your time to receive
them will arrive.”</p>

<p>The measured dryness of the young man’s manner
set the bar in a twitter.</p>

<p>“Damn his young eyes,” said a barrister of elephantine
proportions on the back bench to a colleague;
“two birds with one stone. I shall stand
him a bottle. I like his mug.”</p>

<p>The opinion of the ex-president of the Oxford
Union was less favorable.</p>

<p>“Funny chap, isn’t he?” drawled the product
of Eton and Christchurch. “What can he do for
the case by trying to score off the judge and a silk
gown?”</p>

<p>“Theoretically he’s wrong,” said the son of the
Master of the Rolls; “but it was very nicely done.
I am sure my guv’nor would have liked it.”</p>

<p>Divested of its endless interruptions, the cross-examination
of the woman was conducted with that
persuasiveness he had used from the first. And to
those acquainted with the immensely difficult art
Northcote was essaying, it became a source of surprise
that so young a man should evince this perfect
command over the means he employed, when the
high-strung nerves of the natural man were subjected
to such severe trials from an opponent. And
the reward of his restraint came to him as he proceeded,
for the wretched woman was melted to
tears by such a sympathetic tenderness; and further,
the intercourse he had already established with the
jury seemed to deepen.</p>

<p>“It is due to the courtesy of the police that you
are able to follow your calling?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“The police could take away your means of livelihood
without giving you warning; and without
giving you a moment’s notice they could put you
in prison?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And whenever the police ask you to serve them,
whenever they ask you to oblige them in any way,
you feel obliged to carry out their wishes, whatever
the cost may be to yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Even when they cause you to hurt a friend by
stating that which you know to be not quite
true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“On one occasion, Mrs. Walsingham, to help the
police, you identified a man whom they suggested
had robbed you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And your own testimony and the testimony of
several of your friends enabled them to send this
unfortunate man into penal servitude?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I use the word ‘unfortunate,’ Mrs. Walsingham,
because this man, after languishing many
years in prison, was able to prove, to the satisfaction
of his fellow creatures, that he was perfectly
innocent of the scandalous charge that was brought
against him. But at the time of his conviction,
when the police had called upon you for your help,
you did not dare to tell the judge and the jury that
you had not been robbed by this man, and that you
had never seen him in your life before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“This was an instance in which you felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
necessity, in spite of all that it cost you, to help the
police in obtaining one of those ‘convictions’ which
they consider so necessary to their own well-being?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“One of those ‘convictions’ which mean an extra
stripe on the arm, and the addition of a few shillings
a week to the pay of one or two of these natural
enemies of yours, of whom you and your
friends stand in constant dread?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And so, Mrs. Walsingham, these enemies of
whom you stand in such great fear having, in the
first instance, caused you in your weakness to affirm
that which was untrue, in order that the liberty of
an unhappy man, whom you had never met, might
be taken away from him, they cause you now to
come again into this court to swear away, not the
liberty, but the life, of a poor friend, whose only
fault, as far as you know, is that occasionally she
drank a glass more than was good for her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harrison often spoke to you of this Mr.
Barron?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of late Mrs. Harrison had complained to you
of Mr. Barron being unkind to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“She told you that he had even threatened to
leave her altogether?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“When you first knew her, Mrs. Harrison seemed
attached to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“That is to say, she never complained about
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“But when latterly he grew unkind to her she
became very unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And was it not at such times that she was inclined
to drink that extra glass to forget her great
unhappiness?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yet it was only under these conditions, when a
stimulant had excited her feelings, that she was
heard to complain against him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And then it seemed to you no more than the
legitimate complaint of a highly emotional and
affectionate nature which was suffering deeply?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You remember, Mrs. Walsingham, that on one
occasion she made a reference to her previous history?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“It was to the effect that this Mr. Barron and
herself came from the same village in the north of
England?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That they had been intimately acquainted in her
youth?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That as a young girl she had been in domestic
service at the house of Mr. Barron’s mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Barron seduced her under a promise
of marriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And it was the fact that that promise had not
been kept which led directly, in the first instance, to
the ruin of this young girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Barron having accomplished her ruin,
fled from the house of his parents to London, to escape
his duty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And this girl, dismissed from her situation, disgraced
in the eyes of her friends, followed in her
despair to this huge city, in the slender hope of
finding the man who had ruined her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yet for many years she was unable to find
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And during those years of inexpressible bitterness,
in her ignorance of life, her helplessness, her
friendlessness, in the abasement of her spirit, she
sank deeper and deeper into degradation?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The pure-blooded north country girl became a
harlot by the force of circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And then after many years of misery one evening
at a music hall, in the pursuit of her calling,
she chanced to meet the man who had been the first
cause of her ruin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And when he renewed a proposal that he had
made years before, which as a young girl she had
scornfully repudiated, that she should dwell in his
house, not as his wife, but as his mistress, the pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
of her circumstances forced her to accept this
proposal almost with a sense of gratitude?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And, Mrs. Walsingham, you do not believe for
one moment that any thought of vengeance ever
suggested itself to her mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are prepared to swear that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Also, that even in these latter days, when Mr.
Barron became cruel and violent in his conduct
towards her, she never freed herself from his yoke,
never passed from under the spell of a power which,
from the first, had been so fatal to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And that this paltry sum of money which she
believed had been left to her in his will, which has
proved not to have been the case, could never have
counted in the scale of his personal attraction for
her, which, sinister, dreadful, tragical as it had
proved, had caused her at his behest to forfeit
friends, health, virtue, honor, all those things which
dignify life?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mrs. Walsingham; I have nothing
more to ask you.”</p>

<p>The poor drab, tottering, faint, dissolved in tears,
had to be assisted from the witness-box.</p>

<p>This piece of cross-examination had made a
strange impression. The manner in which it had
been conducted by the young advocate had exerted
a powerful emotion upon many besides the weak
and flaccid creature who had been so much clay in
his hands. It had had great success as a <i>coup de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
théâtre</i>. The trained perceptions present had an
uneasy sense that they had been listening to a masterpiece.
Forensically, the means had been entirely
adequate to the end; a supremely difficult art had
been surmounted by an exquisite skill. Each question
had been shaped so naturally, each word was
clothed with such true delicacy, that wonderful
<i>nuances</i> of feeling were shed by the magic of the
living human voice over the sordid and the unclean.
Sentence by sentence the fabric of a story that was
as old as the world was unrolled until it became a
piece of drama. Even professional criticism, which
was avowedly hostile, was half-conquered by the
infusion of human sympathy into that which could
not bear the light. Irrelevant, destitute of real
authority as was the whole thing, it was yet allowed
to be a performance of rare technical beauty, a
pledge of the controlled will-power of its creator.
And like all things which are the fruit of an incomparable
technique—in itself the reason to be of
what is called “art”—it had evoked that subtle
emotion which transcends reason and experience.
And the least accessible to this malign influence
were fain to see that the first nail had been hammered
already into the coffin of the prosecution.</p>

<p>The indication of a fight on the part of the defence
was extremely distasteful to Mr. Weekes and
his junior. Nothing had been farther outside the
prediction of these expert practitioners. It had
been freely anticipated that by luncheon-time the
end would be in view. By then, according to this
prolepsis, the defence was to have called its witnesses
to testify to the woman’s violence when in
drink, which would count for little; this youthful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
novice was to have floundered through his few disconnected
and incoherent remarks to the jury; the
leader for the Crown was to have answered him
in a few perfunctory sentences, which yet would
be in striking contradistinction to the halting and
rather inept performance of his youthful opponent;
the whole was to have been transferred to the judge
with a sense of perfect security, since the case for
the prosecution was so clear and so entirely uncontroverted;
and the judge, very excellent in his
way, and highly in favor of the despatch of public
business and economization of the public time, was
even to have worked in his summing-up by the hour
of the adjournment.</p>

<p>However, this lengthy and irrelevant cross-examination,
which had had to be contested at every
point, had somewhat demoralized this well-considered
programme. A solid hour had been cut
out of it, a solid hour in which both sides could
have addressed the jury; in fact, a solid hour in
which, by an effort, a verdict could have been obtained
and the woman hanged. And when this
tyro, who was conducting his first case of importance
with a coolness that many of his elders might
have envied, intimated that it was not his intention
to call witnesses, and further claimed in that contingency
the privilege of addressing the jury after
the counsel for the Crown had spoken, Mr. Weekes
was fain to inform the court that he would prefer
to reserve his own address to the jury, brief as it
would be, until after luncheon. Accordingly the
adjournment was then taken.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV<br>

<small>MR. WEEKES, K. C.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in no amiable mood that Mr. Weekes
went to lunch with his junior. All his arrangements
had been spoiled by “the fellow on the other
side.” Instead of the case being in a stage that
would permit him to leave it to devote his afternoon
to business in another court, it began to seem
that it might be prolonged indefinitely.</p>

<p>“So like a beginner,” said the leader to his
junior; “must spread himself on the slightest opportunity.
When he’s been at it as long as we have
he’ll be wiser. So stupid to waste an hour of
valuable time in that way. But, after all, it’s a
golden rule to expect a beginner to fight a hopeless
case. One ought to have known.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure it is hopeless, Weekes?” said his
junior quietly.</p>

<p>“Why ask the question?” said Mr. Weekes,
irritably. “The case is as dead as this mutton.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid there is a little life in,”
said Mr. Topott, tasting the mutton ominously.
“Waiter, if you don’t mind, I’ll try the beef.”</p>

<p>“That confounded cross-examination—so
stupid—so unnecessary—put everybody out,”
said Mr. Weekes, snappishly, at each mouthful.
“Waste of public time—may well want more
judges—ought to allow judges more power—better
for everybody—save time and money—save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> 
youngsters from making fools of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Also enable us to get in an extra round of golf
on a Saturday,” said Mr. Topott, viewing the beef
he had exchanged for the mutton with a deep suspicion.
“But seriously, Weekes,” said he, “I don’t
want you to leave me until they’ve returned their
verdict. You can just let that <i>nisi prius</i> business
alone this afternoon, and stay with me. I have a
presentiment that things might go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Presentiment!” said Mr. Weekes impatiently.
“Deuce take your presentiments! Waiter, bring
me some red pepper.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, I am frightened to death by that
young fellow,” said Mr. Topott cheerfully. “I
suppose you know who he is?”</p>

<p>“I know what he is,” said Mr. Weekes incisively.
“He is a confounded nuisance.”</p>

<p>“He is the greatest player of Rugby football the
game ever saw,” said Mr. Topott impressively.</p>

<p>“Pity he didn’t stick to it,” said Mr. Weekes.
“Better for him, better for us. But what has his
football got to do with his advocacy?”</p>

<p>“Well, I always think, you know,” said Mr.
Topott modestly, “a man is all of a piece as you
might say. If he is preëminent in one thing he will
be preëminent in another.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, my dear fellow,” said Mr. Weekes,
breathing contradiction, a pastime that was dear to
him. “It doesn’t follow in the least. A man may
be supreme as a crossing-sweeper, but it does not
follow that he would be equally great as a member
of Parliament.”</p>

<p>“I am only advancing a theory,” said Mr. Topott,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
more modestly than ever, “but I rather contend
that it does. It is a matter of will-power.
That to which his supremacy is due in one direction,
if evoked in an equal degree in another direction
will result in an equal supremacy. What
I mean to say is, that it seems to me this truly great
football-player has made up his mind to become a
truly great advocate. And that is why I fear him.”</p>

<p>“Moonshine,” said Mr. Weekes. “He is clever,
I grant you; but football-playing and advocacy are
not on all fours, as he will discover this afternoon
very speedily when he comes to address a British
jury.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind my saying so,” said Mr.
Topott, with a very apologetic air, “it struck me
this morning that his football-playing and his advocacy
were very much on all fours. They both
struck me as belonging unmistakably to the man.
I have, as I say, a presentiment that things might
go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Confound your presentiments, Topott! How
can things go wrong? And why a man of your
experience should funk a mere boy who has had
none, I don’t know. He is certain to come an imperial
crowner with the jury. There isn’t half a
leg for him to stand on.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t come much of a crowner this
morning,” said Mr. Topott deferentially, “in spite
of Bow-wow and in spite of you. I don’t know
where he obtained his information, but I thought
the whole thing was most artistic. And if the fellow
can cross-examine in that manner, heaven
knows what he can do when he gets up on his
hind legs to address the jury. I tell you, Weekes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
I am frightened to death of this young fellow.
He’s deep.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, my boy,” said Mr. Weekes
tartly, “you stayed up an hour longer than you
ought to have done at the Betterton last night,
waiting for four aces which never turned up.”</p>

<p>At an adjoining table the barrister of elephantine
proportions, who had expressed his determination
“to stand the fellow a bottle,” was entertaining
a select coterie of his learned friends. In his inn
he was justly celebrated as a trencherman among
a society which had always been famous for its
prowess at the board. He rejoiced in the name of
“Jumbo;” and, although his practice was small,
only his adipose tissue imposed the bounds to his
good nature. In every way he was designed by
nature to be one of her most popular efforts.</p>

<p>“Who’s Northcote?” was a question that was
circulating freely. None seemed to know.</p>

<p>“Never heard of him. Never seen his name.”</p>

<p>“Well known in the police-courts, I believe.”</p>

<p>“It’s time he gave them up. His talents call him
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“It was rather poor form, I must say, trying to
score off Bow-wow.”</p>

<p>“It is a mistake a young man is likely to
make.”</p>

<p>“Speaking for myself, I thought Bow-wow was
asking for it. It is the time-honored story of the
old-established firm of the bench and the Treasury.
Once a Treasury counsel always a Treasury counsel.”</p>

<p>“Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy.”</p>

<p>“He was altogether wrong with the police.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“I agree. He ought to have been handled more
firmly.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow furnishes a good example of a lath
painted to look like iron. I should like to have seen
him face to face with Cunningham, or old Tottie
Turnbull. There would have been trouble for
one.”</p>

<p>“For m’lud, I’ll lay a pony. This young sportsman
is quite above the ordinary. He is going a
very long way.”</p>

<p>“It is too early to say. We see so many geese
with the plumage of the swan in this profession.”</p>

<p>“Name! name!” cried the table.</p>

<p>“I expect when it is all reckoned up,” said
Jumbo, when order had been restored, “my young
pal, Jem Smith, is the son of ‘Pot’ Northcote who
went the northern circuit for years.”</p>

<p>“If that is so, Jum, he is already a better man
than his father. Pot died a recorder.”</p>

<p>“I hope the young un will open his mug for an
hour this afternoon. He’s got the finest mask on
him for a young un I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Weekes might easily have to play jack-in-the-box
all the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“In that case poor old Bow-wow will have to do
a frightful amount of scratching at his leg.”</p>

<p>“But the case is too dead to be worth it.”</p>

<p>“That won’t matter to James. He threw down
his gage this morning. The jury will have to sit
tight and hold on to the handle going round the
curves, or he’ll have them in a hat before he’s done
with them. And I’ve seen Bow-wow crumple up
before now.”</p>

<p>“So have we all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Like all notorious barkers his voice is the best
part about him.”</p>

<p>“For my part, I think you are going too fast.
The lad is not so wonderful as all this. He has
done nothing out of the common as far as I can
see.”</p>

<p>“No, dear boy,” said Jumbo, “because you can
never see anything. But a young sportsman who
can cross-examine in that manner in his first murder
case is made of the right stuff.”</p>

<p>“But the witness was as easy as pie. She didn’t
know where she was or what she was saying.”</p>

<p>“And he took an amazing advantage of her.”</p>

<p>“So would any one else.”</p>

<p>“They would, but in a very different way.”</p>

<p>“His cross-examination will amount to nothing,
in spite of the time it wasted.”</p>

<p>“Will it not, though? That is all you know of
a sentimental jury of your countrymen.”</p>

<p>“His attack on the police was monstrous, and he
had no right to put questions in the form he did.”</p>

<p>“So thought Weekes, so thought Bow-wow, but
he put them all the same. And what is more, the
foreman of the jury, a highly respectable greengrocer,
took cognizance.”</p>

<p>“Well, where does his amazingness come in?
She only answered ‘yes’ to everything.”</p>

<p>“Had he wanted her to answer ‘no’ to everything
she would have done so.”</p>

<p>“Of course she would. Everybody could see
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear boy, and what does he do? Our
young friend takes the liberty of inventing every
one of his facts as he goes along. All that about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
her dealings with the police and the murdered man
coming from her native village was so much fiction.
It was a marvellous piece of improvisation.”</p>

<p>“We shall none of us believe that.”</p>

<p>“Of course you won’t, dear boys; you are not
expected to. But as soon as he realized his opportunity
he took an amazing advantage of it. It was
daring, I grant you, an unparalleled piece of
effrontery. I don’t know another man at the bar
who, had he been capable of a <i>coup</i> of that kind,
would have ventured to play it. The whole thing
was the most audacious piece of work ever seen.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Jum, he had no right to do a
thing of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, dear boy, but he did it.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t Weekes stop him?”</p>

<p>“Because Weekes did not know any more than
you. He would be the last man in the world to
see a thing of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t Topott call his attention to
it?”</p>

<p>“Topott also was completely taken in.”</p>

<p>“Then by your own showing, Jum, you were
the cleverest man in court this morning?”</p>

<p>“The cleverest but one, dear old boy. My
young friend Jem Smith was the cleverest by very
long chalks, but my perspicacity is deserving of
honorable mention.”</p>

<p>“It is not the first time,” said the table, roaring
with laughter, “that this fatal drink habit has
caused you to see things.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI<br>

<small>THE PLEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Northcote</span> lunched with Mr. Whitcomb in a
secluded place, where he partook of a concoction
of egg and sherry, and two Abernethy biscuits.
The solicitor’s attitude towards him had already
changed. The fact that he had adhered to his refusal
to call witnesses for the defence was allowed
to pass, because he had been able to show that after
all he was entitled to hold ideas of his own on the
conduct of the case. His remarkable essay in
cross-examination had restored the solicitor’s self-esteem;
the dark horse he had chosen was not going
to prove so unworthy after all.</p>

<p>“Of course you have got the judge dead against
you now,” said the solicitor, “and I don’t quite see
what it is going to do for you; but as far as it
went it was very well done. I can’t think how you
came to put all those questions. Where did you
get your information? It was not on your brief.”</p>

<p>“Never mind where I got it,” said Northcote,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>His composure was much greater than when
his client had conversed with him in the court.</p>

<p>“If only the whole case were not so dead it
might have proved enormously useful,” said the
solicitor. “Yes, it was very well done.”</p>

<p>“Would you say that Tobin would have done it
better?” said the young man, with an odd smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“No, I would not,” said the solicitor. “I will
pay you the compliment of saying that even
Michael Tobin would not have done it better.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the young man drily. “And
now, what would you like to lay against an acquittal?”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a cool hand, I must say,” exclaimed
Mr. Whitcomb, somewhat taken aback.
“For a beginner I don’t think I’ve met your
equal.”</p>

<p>“What will you lay against an acquittal?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind laying five hundred to fifty,”
said the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Done,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“If you had asked me this morning before you
went into court you might have had five thousand
to fifty.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I forgot to mention it, because I was
just as sure then as I am now what the result will
be.”</p>

<p>“Why you should have this confidence I cannot
understand. Really, you know, you haven’t a leg
to stand on.”</p>

<p>“Well, well; I am going to leave you now to
take a stroll for ten minutes. See you soon.”</p>

<p>Northcote went out into the traffic to take a few
mouthfuls of the London air. Fiery chemicals
seemed to be consuming his nerves, and his brain
was like a sheet of molten flame. But sensations
so extreme in nowise distressed him. He felt the
exhilaration of this strange yet not unpleasant condition
to be the pledge of a harmony between mental
and physical passion. It seemed to promise that
the overweening consciousness of power that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
haunted him for so many weeks in his solitude was
about to be fulfilled. The painful self-distrust, the
afflicting self-consciousness which had tormented
and atrophied his energies in smaller cases had vanished
altogether.</p>

<p>As he recalled the achievement of the morning,
he felt a glow of exaltation. Looking back upon
it his mind had been as clear as a crystal, exquisitely
responsive to the will. Every bolt and nut of
the complex mechanism had been in perfect order.
The very words he had wished to use had sprung
to his lips, the very tones in which he sought to
embody them had proceeded out of his mouth. So
profoundly harmonious had been his mind in its
most intimate workings, that he had been able to
convey fine shades of meaning to the jury without
addressing to them a single word.</p>

<p>Already he seemed to know all that was salient
in the character of each individual who composed
it. As he rejoiced in the masterful strength in
which he was now cloaked so valiantly, he felt it
had only to abide with him throughout the afternoon,
and a signal victory would crown his efforts.
And it would abide with him throughout that
period, because all the power of his nature, which
when aroused to action he felt to be without a limit,
was pledged to this contingency. In this overmastering
flush of virility in which he walked now,
he stood revealed to himself as a Titan. Bestriding
the crowded pavements he seemed to be in a
world of pygmies. What was there in the life
around him that could stem this vital force? No
longer did he doubt that it was in him to dominate
the judge, the jury, and the prosecution. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
were none of his clay; their mould was not the
mighty one nature had used for his fashioning.</p>

<p>With an extraordinary boldness and elasticity in
his steps he walked back into the court. How dear,
how precious, had the fetid and hideous room become
to him already! It is a ruthless joy that consumes
the orator, when, clad in his strength, he
stands up in that forum which previously his failures
have caused him to dread, but which the lust
of triumph has rendered indispensable to his being.
This day would be written in its memorials. It
would mark the first of a succession of achievements
within its precincts, achievements which
would cause his name to be handed down in its
archives forever. Who among the listless occupants
of the surrounding benches foresaw that they
were on the threshold of another miracle that was
about to happen in the world? Who among them
foresaw that a demigod was about to rise in their
midst?</p>

<p>Those venal, high-living men, whose flesh was
overlaid in luxury, how could they hope to understand
the miracle that was about to occur? How
could the poor drab, cowering in the dock, whose
life so ironically had become the pretext for the
first announcement of his genius, how could she
hope to understand that a new force was about to
take its walk in the world? How dismal, coarse,
and sordid everything seemed! Not a glimpse of
light, beauty, or hope was anywhere to be discerned
in the whole of that crowded and suffocating room.
The darkness and horror which oppress us so much
in the streets of a great city, all the festering sores,
all the blunt evils which discolor human nature and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
conspire against its dignity, seemed to have congregated
here. The most cruel fact of human existence,
the knowledge of man’s innate imperfection,
appeared to be concentrated, to be rendered visible
in this inferno in which every aperture was kept so
close.</p>

<p>As soon as the judge returned into court, Mr.
Weekes rose to address the jury. Northcote sought
sternly to curb his own impatience while the trite
voice of the counsel for the prosecution marshalled
the array of facts. They were so damning that
they hardly called for comment. None could dispute
the tale that they told; and the Crown had no
wish to waste the time of the court by laboring the
obvious. Reposing an implicit confidence in the
triumph of a virgin reason, that one imperishable
gift of nature to mankind, Mr. Weekes was yet
able to exhibit a profound sorrow for the terrible
predicament of the accused, and the awful alternative
with which twelve of her countrymen were
confronted. But painful as was their duty, and
painful as was his, it was imposed upon them by
the law. Mr. Weekes resumed his seat in the midst
of a deep and respectful silence, which indicated
how crucial the situation was to all, after having
spoken for three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>The uninspired but adequate words of his opponent
had galled Northcote at first, so overpowering
was his desire to rise at once and deliver that utterance
with which his whole being was impregnated.
But as perforce he waited and his ears were
fed by the formal phrases of his adversary, his
nervous energy seemed to concentrate under the
effort of repression. And when at last a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
hush informed him that his hour had arrived, which
at a time less momentous would have unnerved him
altogether, and he rose to his feet, to such an extent
was he surcharged with emotion that at first
he could not begin.</p>

<p>Every eye in the crowded building was strained
upon him almost painfully, as he stood with locked
lips looking at an old woman in a bright red shawl
in the public gallery. He was as pale as a ghost,
his cheeks were so cadaverous that in the murky
light of the gaslit winter afternoon they presented
the appearance of bones divested of their flesh.
But there was a profound faith among the majority
of the slow-breathing multitude. Since the morning
the name of the advocate had come to be bruited
among them; and in spite of his silence, which was
grinding against their tense nerves, there was that
in his bearing which excluded all sense of foreboding
from their minds.</p>

<p>A full minute passed in complete silence while
the advocate stood staring at the old woman in the
red shawl. At last his lips were unsealed, slowly
and reluctantly; the first words that proceeded
from them were of a quietude which pinned every
thought. All listened with a painful intensity without
knowing why.</p>

<p>“My lord, gentlemen of the jury: It is with feelings
of awe that I address you. This is the first
occasion on which my inexperience has been summoned
to bear the yoke of a great task; and here
on its threshold I confess to you without shame
that I should faint under its burden, had I not the
knowledge that I hold a mandate to plead the cause
of not the least of God’s creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“You must have heard with admiration the
words which have fallen from the lips of the learned
gentleman who has pleaded the cause of the Crown.
Impregnable in his learning, ripe in his judgment,
he has made it impossible for the tyro who stands
before you to imitate his force and his integrity.
Indeed, I do not know how this tyro would derive
the courage to follow him at all were it not that
a special sanction had been given to him by the
grievous circumstances of this case. It is because
its nature is so terrible that he who has to share
its onus is able to forget his youth, his weakness,
his absence of credentials.</p>

<p>“We are proud, we citizens of London, that we
are born of the first race of mankind, in the most
fortunate hour of its history. It is our boast that
we are the inheritors of a freedom that was never
seen before on the earth; a freedom not only of
conduct and intercourse, but more rarely, more
preciously, a freedom of opinion, a freedom of ideas.
And we prize this birthright of ours not merely
because our fathers purchased it for us with their
blood, but also because its possession is of inestimable
worth in the progress of human nature.
And in the very centre of this pride of ours, which
is intellectual in its source, there arises, as the bulwark
of our homage, the more than sacred edifice
which has crystallized the national life. I refer to
the constitution of England.</p>

<p>“We do well to accept this institution with an
unreserved emotion which, as a race, we regard as
unworthy. For there are some who hold that this
hiatus between our precepts and our practice confers
a yet deeper lustre upon our love of justice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
For, gentlemen, that love is innate in the heart of
every Englishman; it is the stuff of which our constitution
is composed, which quickens our pulses
and tightens our throats; it helps to form the most
magnificent of all our traditions; it is the woof of
a fabric which is imperishable.</p>

<p>“It is the thought of this love of justice dominant
in the breast of every London citizen, which
sustains him who pleads the cause of the accused.
For in a charge of this awful nature the constitution
enacts with a noble wisdom that the prisoner
at the bar is entitled to any doubt that may arise
in any one of your minds in regard to the absolute
conclusiveness of all the evidence that may be urged
against her. That is a humane provision, gentlemen.
It is worthy of the source from which it
springs. Without this provision I do not know
how any advocate would be prevailed upon to incur
his responsibility; nor, gentlemen, do I know
how any jury of twelve humane and enlightened
Englishmen would be gathered into this court to
adjudicate upon the life or death of an Englishwoman.
It is a humane and far-sighted provision,
and it enables the advocate of this unhappy Englishwoman
to address you with a feeling of security
which otherwise he could never have hoped to possess.</p>

<p>“I feel, gentlemen, that the exigencies of this
case may compel me to speak to you at great length,
but of one thing you may be assured. I shall not
speak at all unless every word I am called to utter
is weighed with care and fidelity in the scales of
the reason that God has given to me, and I know,
gentlemen, from the look upon your faces, that with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
equal care and equal fidelity you will weigh them
in the scales of the reason God has given to you.
I have placed myself in the most favorable position
for addressing you I can devise. I shall hope to
speak with the utmost distinction of which I am
capable; and I shall hope not to employ a word
whose meaning is obscure to you, or a phrase which
is equivocal or open to misconstruction. That you
are prepared to surrender your whole attention to
me you tell me with your looks. That I shall hold
that attention I dare to believe, unless the hand of
Providence deprives me of the power to give utterance
to those things with which my mind is charged
to the bursting-point.</p>

<p>“You will not refute me when I assert that the
fact in our common experience which at the present
time has the greatest power to oppress us is the
imperfection of human nature. And upon entering
a court of justice this fact is apt to demoralize
a feeling mind. The science of appraising criminal
evidence has been carried among us to a curious
pitch, as witness the unexampled skill of my learned
friend; the paraphernalia of incrimination, if the
expression may be allowed to me, is consummate;
but in spite of the rare ingenuity of great legal
minds, human nature is fallible. It is liable to err.
It does err. To the deep grief of science it errs
with great frequency. Indeed, its errors are so
numerous that they even impinge upon the sacred
domain of justice. Miscarriages of justice occur
every day.</p>

<p>“In a cause of this nature it is most necessary
that steps should be taken to exclude the element
of injustice by all means that are known to us. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
are bound, gentlemen, to keep that contingency constantly
before our eyes. Such a contingency fills
me with trembling; and I believe it fills you, for in
this instance a miscarriage of justice would not
only be irreparable, it would be a crime against our
human nature.</p>

<p>“The question arises, how can we safeguard ourselves
against this element of injustice? What
means can we adopt to keep it out? Gentlemen, it
devolves upon me, the advocate of the accused, to
furnish that means. By taking thought I shall endeavor
to provide it. To that end I propose to
divide what I have to say to you into three parts.
The first will deal with your legal duty. The second
will deal with the duty to which every Christian
Englishman must subscribe or forfeit his name, and
with his name the title-deeds of his humanity. The
third will show the consequences which must and
do wait upon the evasion of this second duty, which
is the highest and noblest known to mankind, which
in itself completely transcends this legal one, this
technical one you are sworn to obey.”</p>

<p>“I can see he means to be all night,” said Mr.
Weekes to his junior, with marked irritation.
“Lover of the sound of his own voice.”</p>

<p>“He is going wrong already,” said Mr. Topott
complacently. “Saying too much; overdoing it
generally.”</p>

<p>“Every inch a performer,” said Jumbo at the
back to a companion. “There’s a fortune in that
voice and manner. Hope the lad won’t say too
much.”</p>

<p>“Has done already,” said his companion. “That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
cant of a duty higher than the legal one is merely
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>The ex-president of the Oxford Union and his
friend, whose youth rendered them sternly critical,
were following Northcote’s every word with the
closest attention.</p>

<p>“He’s got a brogue you could cut with a knife,”
said the ex-president, with an air of resenting a
personal injury.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said his friend, with an absence
of compromise. “He was at school with me.”</p>

<p>By this time the advocate had cut into the heart
of his subject. In a few swift yet unemphasized
sentences he had proved the existence of a doubt in
the case. He pressed home the significance of that
fact with a power that was so perfectly disciplined
that it did not appear to exert itself, yet it carried
a qualm into the camp of the enemy. He was content
to indicate that the doubt was there, and with
apparent magnanimity differentiated it from that
which in his view must ever accompany circumstantial
evidence. Every gesture that he used in
the demonstration of its presence, each vibration
of a voice which had become marvellously flexible,
was a living witness of the dynamic quality he had
in his possession.</p>

<p>“He will be wise to let it go at that,” was the
opinion of Mr. Weekes. “He has done quite as
well as was to have been expected. We shall just
get home, and for a beginner he will have done
very nicely.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me if he is only just starting,”
said Mr. Topott mournfully.</p>

<p>“I have done now, gentlemen,” Northcote continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
“with the legal aspect of this case. That
aspect, as I have shown, makes an acquittal necessary.
But whenever we are content to base our
judgment upon technicalities, we tie our hands.
We furnish room for one of those sophistries which
trained intellects, the intellects of those who are far
more learned in the law than we are, find it so easy
to introduce. There is always the danger that a
body of laymen, however unimpeachable their integrity,
may be led from the plain and obvious path
of their duty by a cunning stratagem. Again, in
all those matters that seek ascertained fact for their
basis, we must not forget that its supply is partial.
Science is doing stupendous things for the world,
but even it cannot yet supply mankind with anything
beyond half-truths. There is no field of man’s
activities—philosophy, religion, politics, law—which
does not depend upon these. Science can
furnish us with sufficient evidence to hang a fellow
creature, but the time is at hand when it will also
have furnished us with such abundant knowledge of
our eternal fallibility, that we shall cease to exact
these reprisals. For are not all reprisals, which we
include under the comprehensive term ‘justice,’ the
fruit of an imperfect apprehension of the nature of
man? It has been said truly that a little knowledge
is dangerous, for in looking at the history of
human opinion in all the phases through which it
has passed, we see how the habit of basing our
actions upon half-truths has been the cause of the
manifold wounds of the world.</p>

<p>“I think, gentlemen, I have said enough to indicate
the dangers which lurk in the temptation to
apply in its arid literalness the letter of the law. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
am aware that such a precaution tells against the
cause I am pleading, because, as I think I have
made clear to you, the letter of the law demands
the acquittal of the prisoner at the bar. But those
who seek for direction in great issues must strive
to forget their personal cause. According to the
law you are pledged to obey your duty is clear;
but as every day its tendency to err becomes more
visible, I feel I must not, I feel I dare not, place
too implicit a trust in its clemency. Therefore,
gentlemen, I am about to supplement this law, I am
about to reinforce it, and to reinforce you, by a
reference to that moral code which each and every
one of God’s citizens carries in his own heart, that
is the only tribunal known to mankind that is not
liable to error. And I think you will agree with
me that the nature of this case allows me to partake
of the inestimable boon of appealing to it.</p>

<p>“When I watched you defile into this dismal
room this morning, one after another, faltering and
uncertain in your steps, and bearing about you many
evidences of having been overcome by the cruel
task which had been imposed upon you by no will
of your own, my heart went out to you, and I could
not help reflecting that I would rather be in my
own case, awful as it was to me, than I would be
in yours. I at least could walk upon the higher
ground without misgiving. I had not been pressed
into the service of this court of justice to make
obeisance to a ruthless and obsolete formula. I
was not called upon to subscribe to a compact that
was repugnant to my moral nature; I was not called
upon to enact the brutal travesty of sealing it with
my lips. But, my friends, as I marked you this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
morning, with a great fire burning in my veins, I
wondered by what miracle it was, I wondered by
what signal act of grace, I too did not stand among
you in my capacity of a private citizen, to bear my
part in this saturnalia of justice. Who was I, that
I should not be plucked from among my family
and my friends, from my peaceful vocations and my
modest toil, to do to death a woman? Who was
I, that I should be exempt from this bitter degradation
which my peers are called upon to suffer?
And in thinking these thoughts, my friends, it
came upon me suddenly—call it a prophetic foresight
if you will—that one of these days I should
be called to sit among you. And I said to myself,
‘When that comes to pass, what will you do?’
I said to myself, ‘What will you do?’</p>

<p>“At first I could make no answer. I was stupefied
by the thought my too active imagination
had conjured up. And then at last I said to myself,
‘I shall ask for guidance in this matter; I
shall ask for guidance from that tribunal which lies
within my own nature.’ And, my friends, there
and then I turned to it, as though this thing had
come of a verity to pass, for the sight of you all
seated there in your despair had borne upon me
so heavily that your situation had become my own.</p>

<p>“Now the answer that tribunal vouchsafed to me
was this: ‘Consider what your pastors and masters
would do were they placed in your case. Consider
what would be the attitude of those great minds
that still burn like candles in the night of the time,
whose radiance has warmed your veins, whose immortality
has enriched your own personal nature.
Consider what would be the conduct of those representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
spirits of whom you proud Englishmen
of the twentieth century are the heirs.’</p>

<p>“And then a strange thing happened. No sooner
had this answer been written on the tablets of my
brain, than this gaslit room grew dimmer than it
already was, and there seemed to arise a kind of
commotion among you gentlemen of the jury. And
when at last I found the courage to lift my eyes
outwards from my thoughts, and they looked
towards you, I saw with a thrill of surprise, as if
by the agency of magic, that each one of your faces
had been blotted out. Each was shrouded in an
intense darkness. But while I continued to gaze
upon the place that had contained you, almost with
a feeling of horror, a shadowy haze seemed to play
over it, and a number of strange faces peopled the
gloom. They were more than twelve in number;
they were more than twenty; they were more than
a hundred. For the most part they were those of
men old and austere. Each face seemed to be that
of a person of infinite power and dominion, of one
accustomed to walk alone. Each was marked by
a kind of superhuman composure, as though having
spent its youth in every phase of stress, it had
emerged at last upon the summits of the mountains,
where the air is rarefied, and where it is possible
to hold a personal intercourse with Truth. Some
of the faces were grave, some a little sinister, but
the eyes of each had a forward, upward look which
conferred an expression upon them of entrancing
beauty.</p>

<p>“Stealthily, rapidly, but with a superhuman composure
these noble shadows ranged themselves in
the jury-box, in the room of you gentlemen who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
had vacated it. And when I had overcome my
stupefaction sufficiently to look upon these new
jurors more closely, I was struck with amazement
at the curious familiarity of those faces of theirs.
They were those of persons that I had seemed to
have known all my life.</p>

<p>“There and then a shiver of recognition crept
through my veins. I knew them; I revered them,
I had spent many hours in their company. The
first face I had recognized was that of an old man,
urbane and ironical, a citizen of the world; it was
the face of Plato. Beside him was a man, older,
less urbane, more ironical; it was the face of Socrates.
Thinkers, warriors, saints, and innovators
began to teem before my gaze. There was St.
Augustine and St. Francis of Assisi, Shakespeare
and Goethe, Leonardo and Dante, Washington and
Cromwell, Kant and Spinoza, Isaac Newton, Giordano
Bruno, Voltaire. I thought I discerned the
faces of at least two women among this assembly;
one was that of Joan of Arc, the other that of
Mary the Magdalene. There appeared to be hosts
of others of all times and countries which sprang
into being as I gazed, but though I recognized
them then, I cannot pause to enumerate them now.
For this gathering was strangely representative,
and the living were not excluded—I saw a great
Russian, a great Englishman, and a great Frenchman
of our own day—but I must resist the temptation
to give the names of all I beheld.</p>

<p>“No sooner had the scope and representativeness
of this gathering declared itself and it had
ranged itself miraculously within a little room, than
a kind of commotion overspread it. They seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to be discussing some difficult point among themselves.
However, this action of theirs had no time
to engage my anxiety, for I understood immediately
that they were seeking a foreman to their
jury. Now you would suppose that among a concourse
of all who had attained an immortal preëminence
in mental and moral activity, to choose
a leader from amongst them would be impossible.
But this was not so. Their discussion was over
almost before it began. They had no difficulty
whatever in nominating one among their number
to speak for them all.</p>

<p>“It was with an indescribable curiosity that I
observed a slight, strangely garbed figure emerge
from their midst. And when he came to assume
his place at the head of his immortal companions,
which you, sir, are occupying now, I was devoured
by an overpowering eagerness to look upon his
face. And by this time so immensely powerful had
been the impact of this jury upon my imagination,
that it had obtained an actual existence and proceeded
in sober verity to conduct the business of
the court. And I was sensible that the painful
curiosity with which I awaited the foreman’s revelation
of his identity was shared by all who were
present. All were craning with parted lips to look
upon his face. And when at last he lifted his head,
and his pale and luminous features shone out of the
gloom and overspread this assembly, a kind of half-stifled
sob of surprise, a sort of shudder of recognition,
passed over the crowded court. The face
was that of the man called Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>“To myself, however, the recognition brought
an immediate and profound sense of joy. All my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
doubts, my terrors, my perplexities, were no more.
They passed as completely as though they had never
been. The business of the court proceeded, but I
was inaccessible to its bearing upon my task. My
every thought was merged in the personality of the
foreman of the jury. The precise, calm, and harmonious
legal diction of my learned friends lost all
its meaning and coherence, and even the demeanor
of the good and upright judge, who is making trial
of this cause, became one with the glamour which
environed the figure in the jury-box.</p>

<p>“That august jury seemed to sit and listen to all
that passed. By an extreme courtesy which they
were able to impose on their finely disciplined natures,
they gave heed to the ceremonial that was
enacted for their benefit. It is true that there were
moments when they were unable to conceal the smile
of soft irony which veiled their lips; but from the
beginning to the end their patience and urbanity
remained inviolate. The foreman, however, muttering
continually inaudible words to himself, with
fingers twitching, and the hectic pulse beating in his
thin and fevered cheek, never took his eyes from the
rail in front of him. And when at last the time
came for the jury to consider their verdict, they
were able to return it instantly, without leaving the
box, as you would expect such a tribunal to do.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely hope to picture to your minds
the scene that was presented when the foreman, so
frail and thin and yet so full of compassion, rose
humbly in his place. ‘Are you agreed upon your
verdict, gentlemen?’ said the Clerk of Arraigns.
‘We are,’ said the voice of the divine mystic of
the Galilean hills; yet I can convey to you the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
of it no better than could those poor fishermen who
heard it nineteen centuries ago. ‘What is your
verdict, gentlemen?’ said the Clerk of Arraigns,
whose own voice sounded so ludicrously trite in
comparison with that of the foreman, that it seemed
to have no place in human nature. ‘I understand,’
said the foreman of the jury, ‘according to your
laws the penalty is death.’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said the Clerk
of Arraigns, with a quiet dignity, ‘the penalty according
to the law is death.’ ‘The jury return a
verdict of Not Guilty,’ replied the foreman instantly,
stooping to write with his finger on the rail in front
of him, as though he had heard him not.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Weekes rose excitedly.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he cried, “this blasphemous travesty
has gone too far. It must be carried no farther.
It must cease.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Weekes,” said Northcote, turning to confront
him, while a wave of emotion swept over the
court which seemed to make the air vibrate, “I
must ask you resume your seat.” He pointed with
a finger with sorrowful sternness. “I cannot submit
to interruption at such a moment as this. You
hold your brief for the Crown; I hold mine for
God and human nature.”</p>

<p>The hush which followed was broken by a poor
actor among the jury. He had been out of an engagement
for two years, and he had left his home
that morning with his wife sitting with a child at
her breast before a grate without a fire in it.</p>

<p>“That’s true,” he muttered heavily.</p>

<p>“My lord, I appeal to you,” cried Mr. Weekes
more excitedly than ever. “I did not come here to
be browbeaten and insulted. I did not come here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to witness religion made into mockery and dragged
through the mire.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Weekes,” said Northcote with a depth of
compassion in his tone which made many veins run
cold, “a subterfuge of this kind will not serve you.
The jury have no desire that you should make a
parade of your feelings at such a moment as this.
They desire that you will resume your seat, and
relinquish any further attempt to make their task
more hideous than it already is.”</p>

<p>“That is perfectly true,” exclaimed the foreman
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>It was observed by those who were behind Northcote
that in the stress of the mental anguish through
which he had already passed, by constantly plucking
with his fingers at the back of his hands, the skin
had been pulled away and the bleeding flesh was
exposed.</p>

<p>“I appeal to your lordship,” cried Mr. Weekes.</p>

<p>“My lord, I also appeal to you,” said Northcote;
and the poise of his head and the lift of his
chin, as it was directed upwards to the bench, reminded
those who had seen it of the figure of Balzac
as modelled by Rodin in clay.</p>

<p>The dæmonic quality was dominant here, as is
the case always when the gospel of force has its
dealings with human nature. Few had suspected
that this old judge, with his brusque manners and
his great barking irascible voice was no longer fit
to fill his position. His lionlike exterior was no
more than the livery of his dignity. He was not
the man to face a crisis, when above all things an
iron nerve and an implacable will were needed to
impose restraint upon a jury and an advocate who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
were in danger of trampling underfoot the accepted
rules of decorum and procedure. And the week
before the judge had buried his youngest daughter.
When Northcote’s gaunt eyes were turned upon this
old man, who was trembling violently under his
ermine, the tears began to course down his face.</p>

<p>“My God, he’s settled Bow-wow,” said the fat
barrister on the back bench.</p>

<p>“Always was a senile old fool at bottom,” said
his companion. “That young bounder ought to
lose his wig and gown.”</p>

<p>“Shut up! He’s speaking again.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is too much the custom, my friends,” Northcote
continued to the jury when Mr. Weekes had
sat down as spasmodically as he had got up, “to
regard this divine mystic of whom I have spoken
as a supernatural being whose name can only be
mentioned with propriety in the presence of an
elaborate ritual. That fetish dies hard, my friends,
but dying it is, for if ever a human being walked
this earth, whose life and opinions are a great poem
that deserves to be recited in our bosoms and our
businesses during every hour that we dwell, it is
the life and opinions of him who has already given
his verdict in this case. There are very few things
that are of any importance to us upon which we
have not his pronouncement in one form or another;
and though that pronouncement may not
always be coincident with the technical lawyer’s
law of the time, which is understanded of no man,
least of all of themselves, these <i>obiter dicta</i> of his,
delivered upon the spur of the occasion, have already
outlasted kings, dynasties, and nations; and
they are likely to endure when court-houses, jury-boxes,
and scaffolds have long ceased to be.</p>

<p>“A few centuries ago such words as I am now
addressing to you would have sent me to the lions,
and you also would have been torn in pieces for
having deigned to listen to them. It is not a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
years since small children were hanged in this
country for stealing five shillings. A hundred years
before that a woman was burned at the stake for
the practice of witchcraft. It was the custom to
disembowel those who were guilty of a felony; to
break on the wheel those who did not hold orthodox
political opinions; and to burn, maim, cut off
the heads, and inflict indescribable physical torments
upon any person because of his religious
views.</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you, my friends, how these
monstrous enactments were overcome. By the lawyers
who drew their fees from the Crown to put
them in practice? Not so. By those educated
minds that conducted the business of the state?
Not so. These unspeakable crimes committed in
the name of justice were overcome by a handful of
prophets, seers, and reformers, who arose in Israel.
They were common and unrefined, of small education,
and less culture; poor and obscure herdsmen
and fishermen, a pedlar by the wayside; the
keeper of a public-house; a small tradesman in
Lambeth; a miserable grocer of Spitalfields; a
wretched old tinker who passed the choicest part
of his days in Bedford jail. This very Jesus himself,
the foreman of this jury which is sitting with
you in the box, which at this moment urges these
words to my lips, was a common rustic by trade, a
carpenter. And you will remember that he paid
for the extreme unorthodoxy of his religious and
political views by crucifixion upon the tree.</p>

<p>“The tree has gone, my friends, but he remains.
I say the tree has gone. That tree has gone, but
as mankind in the present imperfect stage of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
development, does not dare as yet to trust itself
without a tree of some kind to lean upon, a substitute
has been provided for that cross of wood
upon which it nailed the redeemer of his kind. And
it seems to me that if the divine mystic of whom
I am speaking were again to roam the hills of Galilee,
his fate would be the same to-day as it was
yesterday. In the present phase which has been
attained by our sympathies with those who share
the burden of our so dark and so inscrutable inheritance,
it would be extremely easy for some
learned Treasury counsel in the performance of his
duty to the Crown, to reënact the supreme tragedy
of a world which is filled with tragedies.</p>

<p>“At the present time there is still a tree standing
in England upon which we nail women. They
may be guilty of dark offences, as were the associates
of that Nazarene Jew of whom I have
spoken; their fate, according to the written statutes,
may be sound in equity; some wretched Magdalene
in falling by the way may have stained the
pavements of the street with blood. But if we,
her peers and coadjutors, are to continue at this
time of day to visit her with reprisals, I am forced
to believe, my friends, that all we most cherish in
our national life will perish. And I think I discern
by that which is written in your faces that you
are of this opinion also.</p>

<p>“I have alluded to the two unhappy outcasts who
were nailed upon the tree with Jesus. Technically
they were malefactors; it was right that they should
be immolated upon the altar of the law. Doubtless
the instant the counsel for the Crown had compassed
this desirable end, he repaired to his home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with a substantial emolument and a perfect security
of soul, ate a good dinner, and afterwards lay on
a mat and harkened to the sounds of the lyre. But
I do not think from that day to this the associate
of these malefactors was ever shown to be guilty
of any crime at all, at least of any crime known
to the judicial calendar. His only offence, if offence
there was, was in living before his day and
generation, which, in the eyes of those who are
contemporary, is a misdemeanor of a heinous character.
Posterity only is able to condone a greatness
which transcends its own era. Yet do not
misunderstand me. Technically he was blameless,
technically he had committed no crime.</p>

<p>“This consideration brings me to the final word
I shall venture to speak—the supreme danger of
the tree. It is very dangerous to keep a tree at all.
Whatever is once nailed upon it can never be removed.
The stains sink into the wood, and, strive
as they may, the labors of those who undertake to
cleanse it and purify it cannot avail. Like corrosive
acids these stains percolate through the fibres
and change them to wormwood and fungus. And
do not forget, my friends, that the fibres of the tree
are the fibres also of the national life. A nation
pledges its honor when it seeks reprisal.</p>

<p>“We do well to shudder at the many bitter degradations
which have sprung from this habit of
keeping a tree. Jesus was not the first innocent
person whose blood was spilt upon that oft-humiliated
wood. And he was not the last. Our human
faculties play us such strange tricks that they can
render us certain of nothing. Even a poor outcast
who has fainted by the bleak wayside of life, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
has occasionally drunk a glass of spirits to keep
her from the river, may by some obscure possibility
which the counsel for the prosecution has not been
able to reveal to us have refrained from destroying
the man who has been the first cause of her fall,
although it devolves upon all who love justice—in
whatever justice may consist—to explain away
the coincidence of a packet of poison having been
found in her possession. But, as I say, it is within
the bounds of possibility that the theory of the prosecution
is wrong.</p>

<p>“It would not be the first occasion that an uncommon
zeal has led it into error. A year ago
to-morrow, at these sessions, one John Davis, a
butler, who for thirty years had been a faithful
servant in the household of his mistress, was found
guilty of the crime of compassing the death of that
aged lady, in order that he might spend his own
latter days in the enjoyment of a small legacy she
had left him in her will. In the mind of the counsel
for the Crown, and in the mind of the judge, the
evidence against this man was overwhelming. At
first you gentlemen of the jury were disposed to
see a doubt in the case, but the learned counsel for
the prosecution was so consummate in his arguments,
the learned judge was so emphatic, the array
of witnesses for the Crown was so formidable,
from zealous police-constables, with their way to
make in the world, to experts and past-masters in
criminology who had made theirs long ago; and
the youthful advocate, whom the butler’s legal adviser
had selected to defend him, was so unused
to a trial of this magnitude, for his experience had
been limited, that he failed in cross-examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
to elucidate from a hostile witness an extremely
important fact; and in his address to you, gentlemen
of the jury, he was unable to soften the impression
that the Crown had been able to build up
in your minds.</p>

<p>“I have hardly a need, gentlemen, to reveal to
you the sequel of this painful story. As all the
world remembers, you had in the end to submit to
the inevitable. You, gentlemen of the jury, consented
to a verdict of guilty; a month later the
unhappy man was hanged; and he had not been
five days in his grave when a nephew of the murdered
woman gave himself up to a justice that had
already wreaked itself on an innocent man, and confessed
that he himself had murdered his aunt because
he was in need of her money.</p>

<p>“These facts are green in the minds of you all.
But there is a coincidence connected with this
atrocious story and this grievous case which is engaging
your attention. The counsel for the prosecution
in both cases is identical. He stands before
you framing yet another of those objections with
which he has endeavored to impede the cause of
humanity. I point my finger at him, and challenge
him to deny the truth of the statement I am making.
And by a perfectly logical and natural extension
of this coincidence, the judge who sent the
butler to his doom is seated above you now in all
the panoply of his office. I leave him now if he
is able to deal in a like manner with this poor Magdalene,
who may or may not have fallen by the
way.”</p>

<p>Northcote sat down after having spoken for
nearly three hours. The December darkness had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
long fallen upon the court. The feeble gas-jets
seemed to enhance the shadows that they cast. The
intense faces of the overcrowded building, bar,
jury, populace all electrified, seemed to belong to so
many ghosts, so pale, shining, and transfigured did
they gleam. For nearly three hours had the advocate
cast his spell; yet moment by moment, in the
dominion of his voice and the cumulation of his
effects, he had increased the hold upon his hearers.
At times the tension had been so great that it had
seemed that somebody must break it with a laugh;
but no one had done so. One and all were swept
forward by the contained impetuosity of the orator;
by the restrained and gentle modulations of a power
that played through every word he used; by a ferocious
irony which looked like tenderness, so little
did they understand its nature; and above all by the
irresistible magnetism of a personal genius which
rendered the most perilous obstacles of no account.</p>

<p>None had foreseen the cruel, terrible, yet melodramatic
climax to which the advocate was leading;
and when it came over the minds of those present,
all of whom in the course of the speech, even the
most hardened officers of the court, the ushers, the
chaplain, the javelin men, and the newspaper reporters,
had passed in one form or another through
all the anguish of the spirit of which they were
capable, pity and horror were mingled with their
overwrought surprise. As the advocate stood with
his huge and livid face turned upwards towards the
judge, with an ineffable emotion suffusing it, and
the old man, with tears dripping quickly on to his
ermine, put his two fat, white hands before his eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
a feeling of silence and terror seemed to pervade
the court.</p>

<p>The advocate sat down with parched lips. The
hush that ensued was so long that it seemed it would
never come to an end.</p>

<p>It was broken by a commotion among the public
benches. A woman who had fainted was being
carried out at the back of the court. The incident
served to unloose the electricity which was pent up
in the atmosphere. A voice from the solicitor’s
well was heard to pronounce the word “Shame!”
In an instant it was answered by the multitude with
a volley of the wildest cheers that was ever heard in
a court of justice. All the ragged, tattered, despised,
broken and rejected units of the population,
those humble, hungry, and inarticulate creatures
upon whom Jesus himself had wrought his magic,
upon whom he had depended for countenance, took
up the challenge, and with their wild and hoarse
cries flung it back upon him who had uttered it.</p>

<p>For a time the scene was one of consternation.
The judge was but a poor, senile, old man, from
whom the tears were leaping. Every official looked
towards him for his prop and stay, but all there was
to see was feeble and inept old age. The Clerk of
Arraigns, as pale as a ghost and trembling violently,
was spreading his hands before an alderman. Policemen
stood dismayed, and officers of the court,
who had grown old and despotic in its service,
looked towards one another helplessly, seeking for
that authority which none had the power to exercise.</p>

<p>“I never thought,” said the companion of the fat
barrister, “we should come to this in England. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
is a disgrace to English justice. That fellow must
be brought before the general council. They must
take away his wig and gown.”</p>

<p>“A little less prejudice and a little more appreciation,
dear boy,” said the fat barrister, wiping his
eyes stealthily. “That lad will be a peer of the
realm long before they make you a stipendiary.”</p>

<p>“He is either the greatest madman or the greatest
genius who was ever called to the bar.”</p>

<p>“Probably both, dear boy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII<br>

<small>THE SUMMING UP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> barrister who had ventured to give a public
expression to his opinion was that nursling of
wealth, the youthful ex-president of the Oxford
Union.</p>

<p>“You’ve done it now,” said the son of the Master
of the Rolls. “They will have in the roof. They
were only waiting for a leader.”</p>

<p>“With all respect to your school,” said the ex-president
heatedly, “this fellow is a disgrace to it,
also to his profession. It was the act of a black-guard
to throw that at the judge. He is not a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Rough, of course, on the poor old judge, but
he’s playing to win, as he always did. Hullo, the
poor old boy is coming up to the scratch.”</p>

<p>Order had been at last restored, or more correctly
had restored itself; and in thin and shaken tones the
judge began his summing-up. He had conquered
his emotion, and in a perfectly simple, plain, and
audible manner he was able to give expression to
that which he desired to say. It afforded the keenest
relief to the bar, which was so profoundly jealous
of professional prestige, that after all the presiding
judge should be able to reassert himself sufficiently
to invest with a certain dignity his own procedure
in his own court. His words were charged
with deep feeling, but the most critical among his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
listeners could discern nothing derogatory to his
office in his mode of utterance.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury,” he began; and although
the sound of his voice was divested of that
roughness and irascibility by which it was known,
it yet enchained the attention of his hearers, since
intensity of feeling had rendered it singularly harmonious,
“Gentlemen of the Jury, before I refer to
the details of this terrible case I desire to record my
opinion of the manner in which it has been conducted.
The counsel for the defence is a young
man, and in the nature of things his experience in
cases of this kind cannot be extensive. But I would
like to affirm that never within my own knowledge
has a more remarkable presentation of the art of advocacy
come within the purview of this court. Mr.
Northcote is a young man, but the display of his
genius—I can use no smaller word—which recently
he has made, is an honor to human nature.
As an old advocate, I tender my sincere congratulations
to him, and I hope that the career he has
chosen to follow will in every way be worthy of the
nobility of his talent.”</p>

<p>A murmur of applause greeted this eulogium. It
had been rendered with such obvious feeling and
delicacy that every word rang true, and touched the
chord that was dominant in the hearts of all.</p>

<p>“Well done, Bow-wow,” said the fat barrister,
sniffing and blowing his nose, “I trust some old pal
will stand you a bottle at the Forum this evening.”</p>

<p>“That is the English gentleman,” said his companion.
“I expect that young cad is feeling rather
cheap just at present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“Expect nothing, dear boy. Who the devil are
you that you should expect anything? You could
no more have saved that woman from the gallows
than you could have jumped across the moon.”</p>

<p>“There is a vexed point which the counsel for the
defence has touched upon,” said the learned judge,
“upon which I hope I shall be excused if I say a
few words before approaching the case which occupies
your painful attention. In Crown cases it
happens frequently that the prisoner is at a serious
disadvantage in the matter of representation.
Counsel of great eminence may be briefed for the
prosecution, while the defence, for whose conduct,
as a general rule, very little money is forthcoming,
has not the means to secure the aid of counsel of
tried worth and experience. In theory the judge is
assumed to hold a kind of watching brief for the accused,
inasmuch that it is his duty to be alive to any
loophole of escape that may present itself in the
course of the evidence, and represent that loophole
to the jury. But my experience has shown to me
that that loophole is extremely unlikely to appear
where the opposing counsel are unequally matched.
In theory it is expected of the counsel for the Crown
that he shall keep a perfectly open mind and not
allow his own position to sway his conduct of the
case; but a long experience has imposed the conclusion
upon me that such an impartiality as this is
not practicable for an advocate who, in the exercise
of his art, is compelled by the fact that he holds a
brief to exert his talent, in spite of an unwritten law,
and even in spite of himself, to the fullest capacity
on behalf of his client.</p>

<p>“These words, gentlemen, will not be misconstrued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
I am sure. Nothing is farther from my
intention than to suggest that Crown advocates
wantonly overstep their duty or go outside their
jurisdiction. But I do suggest that they feel impelled
to do their utmost for their client, and that
client is the Treasury. And having that very
proper and natural feeling in their minds it is
humanly impossible for them to approach their task
of promoting a conviction in the academic spirit
which in theory is imposed upon them. Therefore
you will conceive how difficult becomes the function
of a judge who is called upon in the prisoner’s interest
to hold the scales and to adjust the balance,
when there is, as occurs so frequently, a grave disparity
between the ability and the professional experience
of the contending counsel. The judge
himself, gentlemen, is only human, and although
his familiarity with the procedure of a criminal
trial may render him less vulnerable to the art of
a skilful advocate than those who are not so familiar
with those forms of procedure, at the same
time I feel entitled to assert that every judge must
in a measure be susceptible to the manner in which
evidence is conveyed to his notice, and the manner
in which it is dissected before his eyes.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, gentlemen, I hope, in
making what may seem to be a digression from this
extremely painful case we are considering, but it is
a point that arises very naturally out of it. The
counsel for the defence saw fit to touch upon it in
the course of his address, and I would like to assure
him and to assure you that during the five
and twenty years I have had the honor to occupy
a seat on the judicial bench, this question has seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
to me of such paramount importance that it has
been constantly before my mind. This is the last
opportunity I shall have of making a reference to
it in the presence of you gentlemen of the jury;
this is the last occasion on which I shall take my seat
in this or any other court; therefore I feel a desire
to record, with whatever authority twenty-five
years of public service may confer on a mere expression
of opinion, the conclusion at which I have
arrived.</p>

<p>“In the ears of many my conclusion will sound
utopian, in many minds it will seem to be a counsel
of perfection, for it is this. In important criminal
cases it is the duty of the Crown to make the same
ample provision for the accused as it does for itself.
It should afford equal facilities to the accused person
to establish his innocence as it affords to itself
to establish his guilt. After many profound searchings
of heart, more particularly upon circuit, where
cases affecting the life and liberty of the subject
are so often left entirely to the discretion of a rural
practitioner, this is the conclusion I have reached.
Such a conclusion will, I fear, be taken as a confession
of weakness on the part of an individual
judge. It is a confession of weakness, gentlemen,
but I do not think I shall be contradicted when I
urge that it is a confession which the strongest and
most able of my learned brethren have been called
upon over and over again in their heart of hearts
to make.</p>

<p>“The terrible miscarriage of justice which occurred
a year ago in this court, for which I alone
can accept responsibility, for which to this present
hour I have not ceased to mourn, would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
taken place had the defence been in a position to
present its testimony, and to marshal its facts with
a skill equal to that enjoyed by the prosecution.
The most material issue in the case was never presented
at all. Its existence was not even revealed.
Neither the prosecuting counsel nor the presiding
judge was aware that the defence had this implement
in its possession until long after this miscarriage
had been consummated. Do not misunderstand
me, gentlemen; I hold no brief for myself;
I accept the whole of the responsibility for what
took place. It was my duty to unveil that which
was hidden, and to present it adequately to the
jury. I failed in that duty, because from the beginning
of the case the defence was overshadowed.
The actual murderer himself was called in evidence
by the Crown; it was upon his unshaken testimony
that the verdict was rendered; but as was only
learned when too late, had one obscure question
been pressed home in cross-examination to this
murderer who had perjured himself to conceal his
guilt, his testimony could not have lived five minutes
in any impartial mind, and a lamentable, a
grievous miscarriage of justice would not have
stained the annals of this English justice of which
very rightly and properly we are so proud.”</p>

<p>Again a profound silence had descended upon
the court. The painful and close-breathing intensity
with which all in that crowded assembly had
followed the prisoner’s advocate through the devious
courses of his address was now extended
to the judge. There was nothing in the words
he used to call forth this hush of excited expectation,
but the emotion with which they were invested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
seemed to furnish them with life and magnetism.</p>

<p>“All his life,” whispered the fat barrister to
his friend, in a tone of curious tenderness, “he has
been a blusterer and a blunderer, overanxious,
pedantic, weak-willed, easily led, but—but his end
is glorious. This is a note he has never touched
before.”</p>

<p>“This state defence of prisoners is so much mischievous
nonsense,” said the other almost angrily.
“Where does he suppose it will land the country?
A judge has no right to advance such an opinion
from the bench.”</p>

<p>“Bill,” said the fat barrister, with a solemnity
for which none of his friends would have been
prepared, “when you have been one of His
Majesty’s judges for twenty-five years you may not
hold quite such definite opinions. Dear old Bow-wow;
all the world knows that underneath his
armor he has kept the kindest heart that ever beat,
but this is the first time he has made me feel that
I wanted to blub.”</p>

<p>“’Pon my word, Jumbo,” said his friend, impatiently,
“don’t you begin. We have had enough
mawkishness this afternoon to last us for the rest
of our lives. I expect Weekes will be falling on
the neck of Topott soon, and the clerk will be
kissing the sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Dear old Bow-wow, dear old boy, how old he
is getting. They say this John Davis affair has
cut him up dreadfully. There is not a judge on the
bench who would feel it more.”</p>

<p>“Probably the weakest judge who ever took
his seat on the bench. What is he maundering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
about now? Ah, at last he’s got to the summing-up.”</p>

<p>The hour was advancing, and happily the judge’s
speech was not of the length which at one time it
had threatened to be. The summing-up was short
but indecisive. It was plain that the prisoner’s
advocate had done his work with the judge as well
as with the jury. There was nothing in the judge’s
presentment of the evidence, which at one time
had looked so damning, to compare with the resolution
and conviction of Northcote. The magnetic
splendor and brilliancy which had overcome, one
by one, the twelve good men and true in the box,
had fastened also upon this old man. His confidence
was shaken, and the definite line the counsel
for the Crown had so confidently expected him to
take was far to seek.</p>

<p>“This is doing us no good,” grunted Mr. Weekes
to his junior. By now the leader for the Crown
was in a very bad temper. His afternoon had been
wasted, he was going to be late for his dinner,
and he was about to lose a verdict upon which he
had counted with certainty. “My dear Bow-wow,
you are positively maudlin. Why the deuce don’t
you leave the doubt alone and confine yourself to
the evidence? There is no doubt. There is not
a leg for them to stand on.”</p>

<p>“There was not half a leg for them to stand on
at the beginning,” said Mr. Topott, with scrupulous
modesty, “but now as the end approaches,
they appear to be standing upon two thoroughly
sound ones. I think I said at lunch I was frightened
to death of that fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>“Much good that did the case,” snapped Mr.
Weekes.</p>

<p>“You were so sanguine, my dear fellow,” said
Mr. Topott, with his modesty taking an almost
angelic note. He was a young man, able and ambitious;
and his private opinion of his leader was
of a nature that wild horses would not have caused
him to expose. “You pooh-poohed everybody and
everything at lunch. The case was as dead as mutton;
their man was a beginner; you and Bow-wow
were going to take care that he did no harm.”</p>

<p>“Well, Topott, I must say you never lose an
opportunity of rubbing things in.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is so,” said Mr. Topott, dreamily.
“Perhaps I am rather good at rubbing things in.
Perhaps that is my <i>métier</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you will provide yourself with
another. To my mind this one is not at all amusing.”</p>

<p>“I suspect that is so. But now this case has
gone to pot, I hope you will not be angry, Weekes,
if I inform you that the fault is not yours. You
have simply been knocked out in a fair and square
battle. But I hope you will not repine; because
there is not a man in England to-day who could
have stood up against that fellow. He chose extraordinary
weapons, but they were those he knew
how to use. No disgrace attaches to you; you have
taken the knock quite honestly; and if the attorney
had been here he would have had to take it too.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Topott,” said Mr. Weekes, tartly;
“I wish I could have your testimonial in writing.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Mr. Topott.</p>

<p>“Just listen to that old fool,” said Mr. Weekes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
petulantly. “Whoever heard such rubbish as he
is talking? It is time he resigned. Nobody actually
saw her put the poison in. Absence of motive. Prisoner
entitled to every doubt that may arise. Every
link must be forged in the chain of all evidence that
is purely circumstantial. No credence can be
given to the testimony of half the witnesses for
the Crown. My dear Bow-wow, I really never
heard such nonsense in my life.”</p>

<p>“An hour ago you never heard such blasphemy.”</p>

<p>“I would to God the attorney had held this
brief!” said Mr. Weekes, desperately.</p>

<p>“You may count on one thing,” said Mr.
Topott; “he will never let you hear the last of
this. Won’t he chuckle? He will pull your leg
about it for the next ten years.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will tell him, Topott,” said Mr.
Weekes anxiously, “that he would have done no
better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t say he would have done no better,”
said the impartial Mr. Topott. “He would have
done better. He would never have let that chap
get as far as he did, even if he had had to ascend
the bench and take poor old Bow-wow by the tippet.
But I do say he also would have had to take his
gruel, and he would have lost his verdict.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have not lost it yet.”</p>

<p>“We shall have lost it in another quarter of
an hour.”</p>

<small>THE VERDICT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a quarter-past seven by the time Mr.
Justice Brudenell had concluded his summing-up.
Long before he had reached the end, a prediction
of the result had formed in every mind. This case
which in the beginning had been as clear and strong
as the sun at noon had become so vitiated by contact
with these legal wits, that by now even its
most salient points had become obscure. No jury
in the frame of mind of this present one, each
component of which had been played upon like the
strings of a harp by the hand of a master performer,
was in the least likely to convict. There
were those who even inclined to the belief that they
would not leave the box.</p>

<p>This, however, proved to be an extreme view.
They did leave the box, but in exactly nine minutes
had returned into court. As slowly they defiled
back again into the court with their verdict,
the excitement depicted in their looks was painful
to observe. Their drawn faces were livid and perspiring;
they kept down their heads without
glancing to the right or to the left. The foreman,
a coal dealer in a small way of business in the
Commercial Road, was seized with a violent
twitching of the body.</p>

<p>“Are you agreed upon your verdict, gentlemen?”
whispered the Clerk of the Arraigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“We are,” said the foreman of the jury, in a
voice that could hardly be heard.</p>

<p>“What is your verdict, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“We return a verdict of—of—”</p>

<p>The conclusion of the sentence seemed to die
in the foreman’s throat.</p>

<p>“Will you please speak in such a manner that
his lordship may hear you?” said the clerk.</p>

<p>“We return a verdict of not guilty,” said the
foreman, with his eyes fixed on the rail before
him. To the horror of many who observed him,
he appeared to trace some words upon it with his
finger.</p>

<p>The demonstration which followed the verdict
had been anticipated, and accordingly on this occasion
the officers of the court were able in some
measure to control it.</p>

<p>No sooner had the judge uttered a few words,
which in the clamor were inaudible, than he rose
hastily from his seat. In the same instant Northcote
rose also, and that voice and presence which
for so many hours had exercised such an unquestioned
sway at once detained those who were
thronging eagerly through the doors into the raw
December darkness.</p>

<p>“Before the court rises,” said Northcote, “I
crave your lordship’s indulgence for a brief moment.”</p>

<p>The judge bowed courteously and resumed his
seat, a little unsteadily as was thought by those
who were near to him.</p>

<p>“I desire to offer to your lordship,” said the
young advocate, with a humility that was affecting,
“in a public manner, an ample and an unreserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
apology for an allusion which had the
misfortune to fall from my lips. I gave utterance
to it in a moment of great mental excitement, and
at that moment I did not realize, so completely was
I under the domination of the end I had in view,
that in a sense such an allusion was an indictment
of your lordship and of that high office upon which,
during a quarter of a century past, your lordship
has conferred honor. I beg to be allowed to crave
your lordship’s forgiveness. Had these words not
been spoken at a time when I was overcome by
the heat of advocacy, they would never have been
spoken at all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Northcote,” said the judge
in a low but distinct voice. “I understand perfectly
well the circumstances in which these words
were spoken. They gave me pain, but I do not
hold you blameworthy. I viewed with keen sympathy
the position in which you were placed; and
I accept without reservation the apology which with
an equal absence of reservation you have conceived
it your duty to tender to me. I don’t know
whether I can be permitted to offer a suggestion
in a matter of this kind, but if, Mr. Northcote, you
could see your way towards the inclusion of your
friend Mr. Weekes in this extremely honorable
<i>amende</i>—”</p>

<p>“I will, my lord—I do!” cried the impetuous
young man, turning towards the place of the senior
counsel for the Treasury.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, my lord,” said Mr. Topott,
rising and bowing to the judge and to Northcote,
“that my learned friend has already left the precincts
of the court; but I feel sure I am entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
to state, that were he now present he would accept
these words of Mr. Northcote in the spirit in which
they are offered.”</p>

<p>The judge left the bench and the court emptied
rapidly. Mr. Whitcomb, who had remained most
of the day in Northcote’s vicinity, plucked him by
the sleeve as he rose and gathered his papers.</p>

<p>“I know now what you mean by the genie,”
said he. “I shall send a wire to Tobin at the
hospital. I should like to see his face when he
gets it.”</p>

<p>Northcote was too highly wrought to appreciate
a word that was uttered by the solicitor. He could
only smile and nod and wish him good night, all
of which was done with incoherence and abruptness.
As the young man passed out of the court,
an elderly unfortunate, without any teeth, one-half
of whose face had been destroyed by disease, crept
from her hiding-place in a dark corner of the
corridor. She grabbed the hem of Northcote’s
gown and carried it to her lips.</p>

<p>“Gawd bless yer, guv’ner,” she mumbled, in a
thick, wheezy whisper.</p>

<p>In the barristers’ robing-room the entrance of
Northcote created a stir. Jumbo, a bencher of
Northcote’s inn, and like all who are not afraid
to present themselves without reserve, just as
nature devised them, a man of immense popularity,
hit the young advocate a blow on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“When can I stand you a bottle, dear boy?
Fine work!”</p>

<p>The son of the Master of the Rolls came up.</p>

<p>“I say, Northcote,” he said, “you don’t remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
me? I’m Hutton. I was in Foxey’s house
with you at school.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said Northcote, hardly
knowing a word that he spoke; “I remember you
perfectly well. You have not altered at all.”</p>

<p>“You’ve not altered much, although you look
awfully old and very much thinner than you used
to look. I want you to mention an evening that
you can come round and dine with my governor—you
remember the governor I used to get ragged
so tremendously for boasting about? He will be
delighted to meet you. I shall tell him all about
this; he is the kindest old soul.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I can’t dine with you until I’ve
got my evening clothes out of pawn.”</p>

<p>Northcote’s schoolfellow laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“No, you’ve not altered,” he said. “Just the
same amusing cynical old cuss you were at school—just
the same cynical old cuss of whom we were
so much afraid and who was so frightfully unpopular.”</p>

<p>“Poverty and pride were never a popular combination,”
said Northcote, aroused from his preoccupation
by the sympathy of one of the few who
had supported him in his youth. “If I hadn’t
been a bit of a football-player I don’t know what
would have happened to me in those days. I used
to derive pleasure, I remember, from insulting
everybody.”</p>

<p>“Foxey used to call you Diogenes.”</p>

<p>“He used to say that Diogenes was considerably
the pleasanter fellow of the two.”</p>

<p>“Poor old Foxey always feared you, I believe,
just as did everybody else. You were a gloomy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
dreamy sort of chap when you were not merely
formidable. I remember once you were nearly
superannuated. And do you remember Foxey
saying there was nothing you might not do, if only
you would apply your mind to it; but as it was,
he was sure you would never do anything?”</p>

<p>“I lived in a mental fog in those days,” said
Northcote, with a dreary laugh. “There was a
thick vapor wrapped all round my brain. I could
see and understand nothing. One fact only was
borne in upon me with any sort of clearness.
It was that I was vastly superior to everybody
else. There never was such a colossal self-esteem.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly despised everybody in
those days. And you must have gone on despising
everybody to be capable of doing what you have.”</p>

<p>“I remember I was generally chosen to lead the
scrum because I had a big voice,” said Northcote,
with the light of reminiscence softening his grim
mouth.</p>

<p>“But your voice is so much greater now than
it was then, although it was always an immense
booming sort of thing that seemed to come out of
your boots. But your hands used to impress me
more than anything else. I used to think that if
I had hands like that I should break ribs for my
private amusement. Do you remember standing
the three-quarters on their heads? You were a
hefty brute in those days.”</p>

<p>“I was always more or less a man of my hands,
yet at the same time was always intensely interested
in myself. I used to consider that ‘Cad’
Northcote—that was my name at school, although
you are too polite to remind me of it—was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
the most wonderful person who had ever been
born into this world or into any other. I used to
lie awake all night taking myself to pieces as
though I had been a watch. Sometimes I dreamed
that I was Napoleon, and that it had come to pass
that he had been chosen to lead the English pack
while he was still at school.”</p>

<p>“Well, that dream came true at any rate,” said
his schoolfellow, with an outburst of enthusiasm.
“You were still with us when you pushed those
Welshmen all over the place.”</p>

<p>The conversation was curtailed at this point by
the appearance of the judge’s marshal.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote,” said this courteous and nicely
dressed official, “Sir Joseph would be very much
obliged if you would come round and see him in
his room.”</p>

<p>“Right you are! I will be round in a minute,”
said Northcote, shaking hands with his old schoolfellow
and declining an invitation to dine in Eaton
Square the next evening but one.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXX<br>

<small>SIR JOSEPH BRUDENELL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the judge’s room Northcote found its occupant
seated in an armchair at the side of the fire.
The light was subdued, and the face of the old
man was in shadow even while he rose to receive
his visitor.</p>

<p>“I thank you for coming to see me, Mr. Northcote,”
he said, in a low voice. “I will not detain
you long, but I hope you will sit down.”</p>

<p>Northcote accepted the seat that was indicated
opposite to the judge’s armchair. His curiosity
was roused in a strange fashion by the manner
and tone of this old man. They were extremely
kind and gentle, almost those which an aged and
benevolent parent might employ when about to
take leave of a favorite son.</p>

<p>“If you will allow an old advocate,” said the
judge, leaning back in his chair and placing the
tips of his fingers together, “to affirm it again, I
have been impressed by your conduct of this case.
My memory carries me back a long way; I have
been more than fifty years at the bar and on the
bench. During that period I have been brought
into contact with the greatest advocates of their
day, and I have been called upon to bear a part
in many of the leading causes. But never, Mr.
Northcote,—I emphasize the word,—has it been
my privilege to witness a performance so remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
on the part of one who is young and untried
as the one given by you to-day.</p>

<p>“In the first place, and bearing in mind the
limited character of your opportunities, I cannot
pretend to know how it has been achieved. Your
cross-examination of the last witness called for
the Crown was, in my view, masterly. I have
always held, and many will support me, I am sure,
that the art of cross-examination is a searching
test of an advocate. To the ordinary person even
moderate skill in that supremely difficult branch
only comes with years and experience. But you
begin, Mr. Northcote, where many of true distinction
are only able to leave off.</p>

<p>“I have always been proud, jealous—I might
say overjealous perhaps—of my profession, to
which I have given the flower of my maturity;
and I have always felt that whatever degree of
talent it may please God to bestow upon a man,
this great profession of ours offers a field which
brings it to the test. You must let me say, Mr.
Northcote, that when I heard you deal with that
poor woman this morning, and I heard you frame
those questions which you put to her with a really
beautiful sincerity which told heavily with the
jury, I felt proud that so young a man could stand
up so fearlessly and so collectedly in his first great
criminal cause and put to so fine a use the talents
that God had given to him. Had you been my
own son I could not have felt prouder of you, and
prouder of the traditions that you were upholding.
Many of the great lights of the past came before
my eyes—Pearson, now the Lord Chief Justice;
Hutton, the Master of the Rolls; poor, dear Fred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Markham, in many respects the most brilliant of
them all, who was cut off, poor fellow, almost before
he had reached his prime; the late George
Stratton; Lord Ballinogue; Walker; Skeffington;
and I know not how many more—but I did not
hesitate to believe, although we old men are tenacious
of our prejudices, that the bounty of nature
had placed you already on their level, and that
great and good and glorious as were all these
names I have mentioned, you were starting at the
point where they were content to end.”</p>

<p>Northcote leaned forward and lowered his head
with a fierce, almost uncontrollable sensation of
bewilderment, in which, however, pain was predominant.
Every word that was uttered by that
low, trembling, old voice appeared to spring from
the heart. It was something more than an old
man babbling of his youth. There was a pride, an
eagerness, a solicitude, in the manner of this aged
judge which seemed to clasp Northcote like the
impersonal devotion of a noble woman to something
more radiant but less pure and less rare than
that which emanates from herself. In the keenness
of his distress it was as much as Northcote could do
to refrain from rushing from the room.</p>

<p>“Yet, Mr. Northcote,” the old man went on,
“if I say this of your cross-examination, which
as far as you are concerned was a thing of the
moment, a mere piece of <i>esprit</i> thrown off without
premeditation, what shall I say of that address
with which you conquered all who listened to it?
I speak no longer as a judge, Mr. Northcote; my
livery is laid by. As I sat there in court with
every chord in my heart responsive to the noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
music of your voice, I felt that you had brought
home to me that the time had come when I had
ceased to be of service to the public. I shall take
my seat on the bench no more. But henceforward
I shall always carry your words in my heart. They
were noble words, nobly spoken; nature has been
almost wantonly lavish to you in her gifts. It has
been given to you, a young man, to show that the
completest abasement of human nature is not in
the gutter. I read the deeper and the truer meaning
that was innermost, the divine message that
was unfolded by the deep vibrations of your singularly
beautiful voice. You revealed to one in
that court, Mr. Northcote, who should have been
engaged in performing his duty to the public, that
no sore festers in our social life to-day like the
organized degradation of the police-court, where
learning, wisdom, courage, and integrity are debased
to even fouler depths than the gutter by their
constant traffic in human misery. Many times,
Mr. Northcote, have I cowered in spirits since I
have been called to my office, but it has remained
for you, a young advocate, a fledgling of a newer
and grander generation, which will touch this
material world of ours to finer issues—it has remained
for you to knock at the door of the citadel
of the oldest of his Majesty’s judges, and to put
questions that he cannot answer. You forced him
to say to himself, ‘Tell me, Joseph Brudenell,
what law you are obeying when you take your
seat on these cushions, and you endeavor to fulfil
the functions of the office to which you have allowed
yourself to be called?’</p>

<p>“When, Mr. Northcote, in the height of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
conviction you dared to swear in your own jury,
you made every member of it actual and visible
to me. You may have been uttering a profounder
truth than you knew—which is one of the many prerogatives
of genius—when you asserted that
every one of those fearful and unhappy tradesmen
had that jury within him in the jury-box. As you
pointed out, we are the heirs of all the ages: the
prisoner and the policeman, the advocate and the
judge. And he whom you caused this jury of yours
to elect as their foreman showed to me how responsible
and authentic that jury was. By the
magic, Mr. Northcote, in which you deal, you not
only evoked that foreman in the spirit, but by some
miracle you clothed him in flesh. That was a terrible
achievement. It was the first occasion that
the redeemer of mankind was seen to be in the occupation
of a seat at the court of Old Bailey.</p>

<p>“I have heard all the great advocates of my time.
I was present on that memorable occasion when
Selwyn Anstruther made his appeal on behalf of
Smith. Anstruther spoke during the whole of
three days; as an orator he would, with equal opportunities,
have been the peer of Gladstone and
John Bright. Anstruther’s tradition is such—he
had killed himself with overwork by the time he was
forty—that he has become almost a myth. But
even this speech of his to which I allude, many
phrases of which I can recall after all these years,
does not compare forensically with this appeal of
yours, to which we had the awful privilege of listening
this afternoon.</p>

<p>“Nature, Mr. Northcote, as I have said, has in
your case been almost wantonly lavish of her gifts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
Like one who was compounded of pure wisdom,
you appear to have sprung from Jupiter’s forehead
completely armed. You have the voice and
presence of the tribune; you add to the power of
the demagogue a cool, elastic, and a subtle brain.
I know not which to marvel at the more, your almost
reckless courage, or that wonderful self-discipline
which bends a courser so fiery to your
lightest behest.</p>

<p>“You must bear with me in patience, Mr. Northcote,
while I exhaust the stock of my superlatives;
you see you have carried an old advocate away
just as completely, nay, even more completely than
you carried those honest laymen. This afternoon
you furnished an old warrior, weary of the arena,
with a few more of those priceless moments which
he had not dared to hope again to enjoy. For
over and above all your other qualities you have
the divine gift which fuses every quality you
possess. You have that sympathetic imagination
which is the gift of heaven. It is a key which
unlocks every bosom. The rich and the poor must
alike bow before it. Things and men, Nature herself,
even the universe itself, if you care to address
your questions to it, can deny to you none of their
secrets. The foreman of your jury, the divine
mystic of the Galilean hills, was the man who was
endowed with that rare jewel beyond all others;
and he, as we read, carried the multitude from
place to place and caused the sea to open that it
might walk across.”</p>

<p>The voice of the judge grew lower and lower.
He had spoken very rapidly, and under the impetus
of an excitement almost painful in one of his years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
Northcote was entranced by the vivid energy of
the old man, and the tremulous emotion with which
his words were charged. It seemed to be uncanny
that he should be sitting there to listen. There
was not a member of the bar who would have
identified in the transfigured zealot who was
pouring forth such strange words the personality
of Bow-wow Brudenell, the irascible old blusterer
who was considered to be so unsympathetic and
hard to please. There was not a word, not a gesture
by which the outer man who had become so
“famous” with the public could be recognized.
This intense mental energy, burning like a lamp
behind the harsh creases in his face, seemed to have
refined him and rendered him beautiful. The
grand passion which Northcote had unmasked
filled the young man with awe. What did his own
imperious qualities amount to in the presence of
this simplicity? How foolish, how divine it was!
This old man, whom he had dubbed in his arrogance
the type of all mediocrity, shone forth with
a lustre which filled its beholder with shame.</p>

<p>The judge rose from his chair with an effort.
Northcote also rose. The old man seized his hand
with a humble gesture which yet transcended a
parent’s tenderness.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” he said in a whisper, “I did
not call you here to listen to this unbridled praise
of your own gifts. But I felt that I must speak
all that was in my mind concerning you, because
I love you—I love you for what you are and for
what you will be. All my life I have had a passion
for my profession, and I bring myself to speak
these words to you, because I feel that I hold within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
my grasp the newer, the wiser, the grander generation
which has sprung already from the loins of us
effete old warriors. You, my dear boy, I dare to
prophesy, will be its protagonist. There is not a
prize which our profession offers which is not already
in your hand. One of these days you will
be called to its highest dignities. I foresee that you
are likely to become a dictator. The imperious will
by which you are impelled invests you with a power
that soon or late will control the destinies of the
state. Therefore an old public servant ventures
to speak to you as he would speak to his own son
were he living to hear his words.</p>

<p>“The material lures of your profession are
powerful, but I entreat you never to consider them.
Be a strong and great advocate who will take his
stand only upon truth. In the infinity of your
nature you are fitted to walk alone in the strait
places. The temptations which will accost one of
such powers will not be light ones, but if you can
acquire that reverence for your calling, that mediocrities
like myself have been endowed with
throughout their days owing to the infinite mercy
of God, that calling has nothing to fear at your
hands. It will derive a new sanction from your
genius. But, my dear boy, this is a terrible gift
which you possess. It is a two-edged sword, and
if in a moment of unwariness, such as has been
known to visit the heroes of which we read, one
of its sharp edges should be turned against the
society in which you dwell, I beseech you to remember
the other edge will be turned against yourself.
He who affirms this is a humble and aged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
servitor of truth, and on that plea I beg you to
forgive his importunity.”</p>

<p>All this time the judge had been holding Northcote’s
hand. Towards the end his voice seemed to
fail, but the pressure of his fingers increased.</p>

<p>“These are my last words,” he said feebly.
“Guard your trust; take your stand upon truth.
May God keep you. One who is old will remember
you in his prayers.”</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily the judge placed his hands
on the shoulders of the young man and pressed
his lips to his forehead.</p>

<p>For a moment Northcote seemed petrified with
bewilderment. This strange message from one
who had run his course to one who was entering
upon his own atrophied the powers of speech and
motion. At last he tore his hand from the judge’s
weakening grasp and ran from the room. In his
flight he seemed to detect the sound of something
dull and heavy falling behind him. Yet in the
depths of his agitation and his shame he did not
stay to look back.</p>

<p>He was soon out in the dark streets. Their
coldness and commotion, their secrecy, and above
all their freedom, were painfully welcome. He had
hardly been able to draw breath in that arena in
which he had fought his battle during so many
dreadful hours. The old madness of movement,
the old insensate desire for liberty overcame him
again, and hungry and weary as he was he proceeded
to tramp fiercely about the raw winter night.</p>

<p>As he marched without aim hither and thither,
up one street and down another, he had no thought
of the astonishing victory he had gained. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
words of the judge had overcome everything else.
They dealt with the future; his victory was already
a part of the past. His pride was so arbitrary
that it appalled and humiliated him to reflect that
any man, that even an aged servitor of the truth, in
the moment of renunciation of the arduous labors
that had oppressed him for so many years, should
have had the temerity to address words of such import
to him.</p>

<p>From one pair of eyes at least, his talents, which
had at last wrested recognition from a jealous,
narrow, conventional world, had not been able to
hide the dangers with which they were girt. This
aged judge had pierced the secret. Those senile
old eyes, alone of those in the court, had seen the
pitfalls which lay beneath his triumph.</p>

<p>He ought to have been overwhelmingly happy
in this new perambulation of the darkness. Yet the
sense of humiliation was paramount. That strength
upon which all his life his extravagant hopes had
been nourished had proved to be even greater than
he had known, but the under side of his nature, to
which he had given rein in order to grasp success,
opened up possibilities that were strange and awful.
Truth and justice had had no meaning for the terrible
genie he had called to his aid. They had been
used as so many cards in a game. The judge was
right: so grievous a prostitution of a noble talent
was a grave public danger. On the first occasion
it had been employed it had compassed a notable
miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p>Towards ten o’clock his wanderings carried
him into Leicester Square. He stayed his steps
under the ghastly lights of a music hall and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
the discovery that he was faint with hunger and
fatigue. With a dismal sense of foreboding, which
habit had rendered involuntary, he thrust his hands
in those pockets which on many occasions had had
nothing to yield. To his joy his search was rewarded
with a sovereign and a halfpenny. As he
held the coins in his fingers a strange weary feeling
of gratitude stole over him. His days of bodily
privation were at an end. Not again would he know
what it was to need food and yet lack the wherewithal
of obtaining it. After all he must not dare
to deride success. Its attributes were substantial,
definite, necessary.</p>

<p>As he crossed the square in search of a restaurant
of whose merits he was aware, the large letters
of the news-bill of an evening journal caught his
eye. Murder Trial—Sensational Speech for the
Defence—Scenes in Court—Verdict.</p>

<p>“Here, boy, a paper,” he said, holding out the
halfpenny.</p>

<p>He clutched the paper greedily and crumpled it
in his fist. It almost seemed as he did so that fame
itself was tangible, that it was something that he
could crumple in his hand.</p>

<p>In the eating-house he passed a glorious hour in
which he devoured beefsteak and potatoes and consumed
a tankard of ale. He read the account of
the trial over and over again, although as rendered
by the evening journal it had no meaning for him.
Even the bald <i>résumé</i> of bare facts seemed far
otherwise than those as rendered to himself. He
could not recognize one of the incidents. Hardly
a word was intelligible to the chief actor in that
crowded and pregnant drama. “Mr. Norcutt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the defence spoke for two hours fifty-eight minutes.
His speech was full of Biblical quotations, and even
the judge was affected by it.”</p>

<p>When he turned out again into the streets a
newsboy came running round the corner of Shaftesbury
Avenue. He was crying, “Here y’are hextry
special. Sensational murder trial—sudden deff of
the judge.”</p>

<p>Northcote bought another newspaper and opened
it under a lamp. In the space reserved for the
latest telegrams, these words were printed upside
down, “We regret to learn that Mr. Justice
Brudenell expired in his room shortly after the
conclusion of the murder trial at the Central Criminal
Court this evening. The cause of death is believed
to be heart failure.”</p>

<small>MEDIOCRITY VERSUS GENIUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Northcote</span> could confess no surprise. But it
struck him with a sense of drama, the thrill of the
unexpected which underlies the impact of the common,
that he should not have discerned the end of
this aged man to be so near. The sounds he had
heard as he rushed from the room must have been
caused by that venerable figure falling to the floor.
Sharply, however, as he felt the knife of reality
in all its brutal power, he yet refrained from speculating
upon the scope of its present operation. He
was now tired out; his brain was heavy. He
pushed on straight to his attic, climbed the dark
stairs, and in a little while was curled under a
blanket with a merciful sleep blotting out the actual.</p>

<p>He was summoned peremptorily from oblivion
by the noise made by the old charwoman in drawing
back the curtains which divided his garret into
two apartments.</p>

<p>“Quarter to eight, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” he muttered, stretching his limbs
and brushing the sleep from his eyes. His slumber
had been that of abject weariness; deep, dreamless,
undisturbed. He jumped out of bed, slipped
on a dressing-gown that hung in rags, and felt
himself to be once more the complete and valiant
man.</p>

<p>When he sat down to breakfast he sent out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
old woman to procure the morning journals.
Throughout the operation of dressing, his mind,
inflamed with conquest as it was, was filled with
thoughts of the judge. In spite of its length, his
career on the bench had only been a qualified success;
he had never lacked adverse criticism. In
the eyes of many he had never been quite strong
enough for his position.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the newspapers, Northcote
turned first to the obituary notices, rather than to
the accounts of the trial in which his own personal
triumph would be displayed. Following the custom
of bestowing even more indiscriminate eulogy
upon mediocrity when it is dead than it receives
when it is living, the newspapers vied with one
another in descanting upon Sir Joseph Brudenell’s
services to the public, and his qualities of heart and
mind. It brought immense relief to Northcote that
this was the case. He was in no mood to suffer
disparagement of that venerable figure.</p>

<p>The <i>Age</i> had a leading article upon the trial,
and it was soon apparent to the advocate that its
hostility towards himself was very marked. It
said: “We venture to think that a more singular
speech was never heard in a court of justice. It
is not our province to advance opinions which encroach
upon the right of counsel to settle for themselves
what is proper and what is improper in the
means they may adopt to safeguard the interests
of an accused person, particularly in cases of this
nature. But it does seem to us, and we believe
this view is shared by the majority of competent
persons who were present in court, that the course
adopted by the counsel for the defence, if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
to become general, would constitute a grave public
danger. Mr. Northcote is a young advocate, whose
reputation is yet in the making; and in yielding
to the call of his ambition, he adopted a means for
the display of his forensic skill the propriety of
which we venture seriously to call in question.
Had Mr. Justice Brudenell—whose tragically
sudden death (to which we refer on page 9) occurred
within an hour of the rising of the court—been
in the complete enjoyment of that mental and
bodily vigor which during a period of twenty-five
years he had taught the public to look for in the
performance of his avocations, we are sure that,
to use a mild term, such a travesty as that with
which Mr. Northcote assailed the ears of the jury
would not have been allowed to invade a British
Court of Judicature. We are sure it would
have been stopped peremptorily at the outset.
As it was, a concatenation of unforeseen circumstances
vouchsafed to the counsel for the defence
a license of which he availed himself to the full.
And the result we can only regard as lamentable.</p>

<p>“The youth and the limited experience of the
counsel for the defence are entitled to be urged on
his behalf; while the physical condition of the
judge which resulted, almost immediately this extremely
painful case had concluded, in his tragically
sudden death, removes from his shoulders
the least onus for what was allowed to take place.
But at the same time it is to be urged upon ambitious
members of the junior bar that yesterday’s
precedent is not one to be followed with impunity.
Whatever the exigencies of the moment may dictate
to young counsel in course of a trial for a capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
offence, public opinion will not permit the introduction
of the doctrines of Nietsche into a
British Court of Justice. The parody which was
perpetrated yesterday upon religion at the Central
Criminal Court must have been peculiarly repugnant
to every reverently constituted mind, while
its effect upon the verdict can only be characterized
as a total failure of justice. Again the effect upon
the advocate who permitted himself to indulge in
an occupation so perilous was demonstrated in a
remarkable and dramatic manner at the conclusion
of his address. The reference he was led into making,
for which afterwards he was impelled to make
an unreserved apology, to the miscarriage of justice
which occurred in the case of the unfortunate
man John Davis a year ago, a reference which took
the form of an impeachment of the learned judge
himself, and of Mr. Weekes, K. C., the senior counsel
for the Crown, can only be characterized as a
gross breach of taste, and an equally gross disregard
of those higher tenets of humanity which Mr.
Northcote in addressing the jury put to a use so
questionable.”</p>

<p>“Well done, old Blunderer,” said the recipient
of this castigation, his mouth full of buttered toast,
and attempting the delicate feat of propping against
the teapot the instrument with which it had been
administered. “In the performance of your ‘daily
avocations,’ my dear old friend, you are to be
admired. The ‘doctrines of Nietsche’ is distinctly
good. Whatever will happen to us in this country
when you can no longer be bought for threepence
I am sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>However, when the young man had finished his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
breakfast, and he had read the article again, he
did not view it with quite the same air of detachment
with which he had contemplated it at first.
By nature he was immensely impatient of criticism.
He accepted his own superiority to all the
rest of the world without question, but like an arbitrary
despot, he could not suffer the power of
which he felt so secure to suffer misinterpretation,
or the motives that impelled it to be called in question.
His pride, after all, was of a ferocious and
aggressive kind. The old judge’s appeal had humiliated
him bitterly. This newspaper article filled
him with the fury that it would have filled Voltaire.</p>

<p>“I see what it is,” he said, filling his pipe. “They
are all in the ring, and they are afraid a rank outsider
is going to break it. And so he shall!”</p>

<p>He finished with a volley of oaths.</p>

<p>The next moment tears had sprung to his eyes.
Tears of chagrin, rage, disgust, of resentment
against himself. How dare he be so arrogant when
the words of the honest old man, spoken while the
hand of death was upon him, were still in his ears.
Mediocrity had its function, its reason to be. Until
he had grasped that elementary truth he could
never emerge, clad in valor and completeness, upon
that high platform which nature had designed him
to occupy. “Cad” Northcote had been the name
bestowed upon him at school by his humbler but
honester fellows: the same term of opprobrium had
now been applied to him in a more public manner.</p>

<p>It was unworthy that he should ascribe the bitter
antagonism he had raised against himself to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
eternal feud of mediocrity versus genius. That fine
gentleman, the old judge, was incapable of bearing
false testimony. Outface it as he might, the flaw
was in himself. It had been there from the beginning.
The genie in which his intellectual pride was
centred was the seat of the canker. Every time he
employed it he must be aware of his fatal gift. It
was a sinister talisman, or, in the words of the judge,
a two-edged sword. Better a thousand times not
to be distinguished from the mediocrity he was
never weary of despising, than to be at the mercy
of a genius that would compass his destruction.</p>

<p>He took up another newspaper, and turned his
attention to an article entitled: “‘Bow-wow’
Brudenell, by an Old Friend.” In the course of a
column of appreciation it said: “Public life is the
poorer to-day by a memorable figure. Mr. Justice
Brudenell had achieved an odd sort of fame. It
rested upon his idiosyncrasies upon the bench;
upon the curious, irascible, barking delivery he affected,
which earned him the name by which he was
always spoken of in the circles in which he moved.
In the judgment of his profession he was hardly
considered to be a ‘strong’ judge, nor was he
widely popular; yet although he had detractors,
he was always listened to with respect. His queer
little tricks of manner and his somewhat formidable
aspect created an impression in the public mind
which cannot be said to have been wholly in his
favor. Yet none could have told from his demeanor
on the bench what the man was at heart.
It would require the pen of a Charles Lamb to limn
him in his quiddity. To his private friends he was
a perpetual delight and stimulus; he stood for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
that was worthiest in the human character. He
kept a too fearful conscience ever to be truly eminent
in public life, but no kinder, humbler, humaner
gentleman ever walked the earth than Joseph
Brudenell.</p>

<p>“It is to be feared that the closing days of this
good man’s life were darkened by tragedy. The
present writer was sitting with him in the smoking-room
of a club, when a fellow member, an occupant
of the Episcopal bench, carried over to him the
evening paper containing the confession of the man
Burcell in whose stead John Davis had suffered the
extreme penalty a few days before. It would engage
the pen of a dramatist to portray the self-righteousness
of the bishop and the horror and bewilderment
of the judge. ‘It has overtaken me at
last,’ said the old judge, covering his eyes as though
he had been poor blind Œdipus. ‘This is the
shadow that has darkened my life during twenty-five
years.’</p>

<p>“His distress will never be forgotten by those
who witnessed it. From that hour he was never
the same. The tragic suddenness of his end was
not unforeseen by those who knew him best. Yet
to the last he was the same gentle, courteous compound
of scholarship and refinement. In no sense
could he ever have been looked upon as brilliant.
No epigrams, no pregnant sayings, no flashes of wit
are recorded of him; upon the bench he was too
much in earnest even to be genial. Every cause
that came before him appeared to engage the very
blood of his veins and the whole life of his intellect.
It was a ruthless kind of irony that fixed upon
such shoulders as these the responsibility for as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
grave a miscarriage as ever darkened the annals of
English justice.</p>

<p>“In his private life he had known great sorrows.
His only son was drowned twenty years ago while
a freshman at Oxford. Had he lived, he was destined
for that profession for which his father had
so profound a reverence. Nothing could have been
more exquisite than Joseph Brudenell’s childlike devotion
to his calling, yet he was always haunted by
the consciousness that the ideals he had set up were
beyond his grasp. This son was to have been the
truer, the wiser, the stronger, the more penetrating
man; yet it was never to be. The accident that
deprived him of this enlarged and completer edition
of himself added something to his latter years that
his faithful circle of old friends found wistful and
affecting. And only last week he lost the devoted
daughter who had been the stay of his declining
years.</p>

<p>“It is safe to say that no man was ever called to
the bar who was more honestly beloved by all who
understood the secret workings of his mind than
was Joseph Brudenell. Subtle it was not, it was
not agile, and it was not profound; indeed the possession
of that simple and unsagacious implement
conferred only one claim to preëminence. It is
as a great and honest gentleman that Joseph Brudenell
will be called to the Valhalla of his gods.
He was past master in one art only: the art which
embraces the amenities of life. Unsympathetic critics
he has had in his public capacity. He has been
called a pedant, a weakling, one deficient in insight;
even his scholarship, which was so laboriously honorable,
has not escaped inquiry; but the void left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
by that massive and ungainly form can never be
filled. In this time, at least, his like will not be seen.
A rare jewel has been resolved to its element; earth
is the poorer by an English gentleman.”</p>

<p>These words served to heighten Northcote’s indignation
against himself. The stab he had directed
at the judge increased in infamy. Already it
seemed as if he had paid an exorbitant price for
his success. However, in the midst of his anguish
and perplexity, he heard feet on his staircase. There
came a knock to his door. It was the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” said Mr. Whitcomb, shaking
his hand affectionately, “do you see you have killed
the judge?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Northcote, “but I saved the life of
your client.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXII<br>

<small>MEDIOCRITY ASPIRING TO VIRTUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advocate handed the <i>Age</i> to the solicitor.</p>

<p>“You may have seen it,” he said. “I am honored
with a leading article.”</p>

<p>“I have read it. It means your removal from
the top story to the basement.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It ensures that your professional emoluments
will not be less than two thousand a year.”</p>

<p>“That would be very well had I not arrived at
the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle.
The penalties are too great.”</p>

<p>“Why consider them, dear boy? Why not accept
the gifts of the gods in a thankful and contrite
spirit?”</p>

<p>“You would have me drink the nectar that they
offer although they hand it in a poisoned cup?”</p>

<p>“You are a queer fellow. You accept starvation
with a dignified humility, but the instant you touch
success—and such a success!—you make a face.”</p>

<p>“Such a success—there you have it all!”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, whoever in this world got off
the mark with such a flying start? You have awoke
this morning to find yourself famous.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I am poisoned; I have got my death!”</p>

<p>“Within five years, if you keep your head, you
will be making a princely income.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“And two days ago you could not afford to pay
for a fire in the middle of winter.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right.”</p>

<p>“Two days ago you could not fill your belly when
you were hungry.”</p>

<p>“I shall never taste hunger again—that honest,
bitter, medicinal hunger that merges the mind in the
soul. I shall never taste again that ascetic clarity
which makes the heart supple and arms the brain.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a Methodist.”</p>

<p>“My father was a country preacher.”</p>

<p>“I expect this is the swing of the pendulum.
You must have undergone great mental excitement
in making your effort—and what an effort it was!
And now the clock has swung right back; you are
below par: you have got the blues.”</p>

<p>“I hate myself; I hate my cursed profession.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the mercury has fallen. The higher the
rise the greater the drop. But make an effort to be
rational. Look at this.”</p>

<p>The solicitor handed the advocate a brief. It was
marked with a retaining fee of a hundred guineas.</p>

<p>“Two days ago that was beyond the dreams of
your avarice. And now it is a mere forerunner of
the beginning. You will be compelled to change
your quarters and keep a clerk.”</p>

<p>“You remind me of the devil—the real authentic
mediæval Mephistopheles,” said Northcote, with
his fingers trembling upon the tape. “You are in
the pay of the genie, you smug-hearted materialist.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the genie again! I am afraid to confess
that that genie of yours gave me a very bad quarter
of an hour,” cried Mr. Whitcomb, laughing heartily
at the recollection. “I was never in such a panic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
in my life. Had it not been the last moment, and
had it not been impossible to get any one else, you
would never have held that brief. You and your
genie frightened me to death. I woke up in a cold
sweat in the middle of the night, wondering what
would happen if you brought the infernal thing into
court.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did bring it into court, did I not?”</p>

<p>“You would never have got your verdict without
it.”</p>

<p>“Yet you were afraid?”</p>

<p>“That was before I knew what it was. But as
soon as you got up to talk to the jury, and you
could have heard a pin drop over the court, I gave
in.”</p>

<p>“That is true enough,” said Northcote, in the
hollow tone which had discomposed the solicitor
at the restaurant, “but once having summoned this
thing to my aid, once having taken it into court
with me, once, as you might say, having let it taste
blood in the arena, I shall be compelled to have it
with me every time. It is already out of my control.”</p>

<p>“So much the better for you and for those who
command your services. This genie of yours will
one day be worth thirty thousand a year in cool
coin of the realm. If you will deign to take the
advice of one who is perfectly willing to be a father
to you, I say to you, don’t overdo it. Employ as
many devils as you please,—five, ten, or a hundred
and ten,—but don’t be tempted into taking enough
work to break down your nervous system. Keep
that intact and you are predestined for the Woolsack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“I feel it; and yet, do you know, Whitcomb, it
hangs in the balance whether I ever walk into court
any more.”</p>

<p>“If you think so, it is little you know of your
nature. What you call the genie will have the last
word to say on that subject.”</p>

<p>“Like every other mud-colored materialist your
intelligence is admirably lucid as far as it goes.”</p>

<p>“Compliments are flying. But is it not the faculty
of youth to despise the common sense to which
one day it is only too glad to return?”</p>

<p>“I would spew mediocrity out of my mouth,”
said Northcote, suddenly overmastered by arrogance.</p>

<p>“Common sense and mediocrity are not quite the
same; but you can take it from me, dear boy, that
genius has always to learn sooner or later that
mediocrity has its uses.”</p>

<p>The solicitor was amazed to see tears spring to
the eyes of the advocate.</p>

<p>“I have learnt that already,” he said huskily;
“I learnt it last night after the rising of the
court.”</p>

<p>“I presume you are referring to poor old Bow-wow,
the type of all mediocrity.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to the poor dear old blunderer who, after
the manner of his kind, consecrated his life to a
public display of his incapacity. Yet I weep for
Adonais, he is dead!”</p>

<p>“I say, my boy,” said the solicitor, amazed by the
depth of emotion that was revealed in the face of
the young man, “you did not suppose for one moment
that I was in earnest when I said you had
killed him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“You struck so near to the truth,” said the young
man, “that you made me bleed.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a consummate kind of folly. You
must feed well; build yourself up; go away for
Christmas; take a rest. Future greatness cannot
be allowed to play ducks and drakes with its
chances.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you, Whitcomb, the weight of a
feather would make me throw up the bar.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! That voice, that presence, that
imagination, that extraordinary dynamic quality—in
other words, your genie, leaves you no choice.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you, Whitcomb, if it were not for
my countrified old mother, who has worked her fingers
to the bone to provide an education for me,
I would never go into court any more.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I shall continue to send you briefs all
the same. I cannot recall another man who has
got a start such as yours, and I shall be astounded
if through a whim you show yourself unworthy of
your good fortune. Here is a check for ‘the
monkey’ you won of me at lunch yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred pounds! I don’t remember anything
of the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I laid five hundred to fifty against your getting
a verdict.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“At lunch yesterday.”</p>

<p>“You must not take any notice of that. I was
very excited. I am afraid I was not myself.”</p>

<p>“Why afraid? The money is yours.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it; I won’t have it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whitcomb had thrust the check in the hands
of the advocate, who tore it up immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“Well,” said the solicitor, “I should say at the
present time you have undeniable claims to be considered
the most remarkable man in London. I
can’t fathom what has come over you.”</p>

<p>“I was thrown off my balance a little yesterday,”
said Northcote hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, my friend, you were a great man;
to-day, you are a prig.”</p>

<p>“You are right. Yesterday, a great man stooping
to foulness; to-day, a mediocrity aspiring to
virtue.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear boy,” said the solicitor earnestly,
“my last words are these. Be guided by your talent.
Greatness is written all over you; it is in
your eyes; it proceeds out of your mouth. Play
up to your destiny, like a wise fellow, and leave
hymns and sermons and disquisitions upon morality
to the official purveyors of those condiments.”</p>

<p>“You are the devil!”</p>

<p>“Well, Faust, dear old boy, if it come to that,
it does amuse me sometimes to think that I have
not dabbled in human nature in divers forms during
the last twenty years without getting to know
a little about it. And I put it to you, do you suppose
I took the trouble—I, one of the most sagacious
criminal lawyers in London—to climb up to
this attic without my dinner at ten o’clock of a
December night, without having taken your size
in hats and your chest measurement?”</p>

<p>“I say, you are the devil.”</p>

<p>“Your estimate is too liberal. There is nothing
of his Satanic Majesty about me; but, all the same,
I am always perfectly willing to employ him. I am
always prepared to pay him liberally to fight these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
causes of mine, wherever and whenever he is to be
found. What you call the genie is, after all, a
euphemism for the devil, although under the more
chaste patronymic I failed at first to recognize that
elderly swaggerer.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, you are shrewd. But you leave a
bad taste in the mouth.”</p>

<p>“Everything does that this morning. But I am
not surprised that you are feeling cheap. The
human frame has to pay for such colossal efforts.
In the meantime, you have no need to worry about
anything. The mercury will rise again; things
will all come right; and you will attain an eminence
that few could occupy. In the meantime,
divert yourself with these, and mention your own
time for the consultation.”</p>

<p>Leaving two briefs, one of which was marked
with the sum to which he had previously referred,
Mr. Whitcomb descended the stairs, much to the
relief of the advocate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIII<br>

<small>THE HIGHWAY OF THE MANY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Success</span> had spread out both hands to Northcote,
but the emotion she had aroused in him was
not one of gratitude. He had spent many days of
suffering, of mental darkness, during the years of
his obscurity, but none had engulfed him in such
humiliation as this upon which he had entered now.
He had tasted coldness and hunger; he had known
the stings of rage and despair; but these sensations
appeared salutary in comparison with a hopelessness
such as this.</p>

<p>How could he cherish an illusion in the matter,
he who knew so much? He had made his choice
deliberately under the spur of need; he had foreseen
its enormous penalties; he had foreseen the
degradation that was implied in the honors and
emoluments that would accrue from its exercise.
Yet, now these things had come upon him, he smote
his breast and lifted up his voice in woe. Less
than a week ago, in the freedom of his penury, in
the license of his failure, he had had the power to
spurn these lures. Yet in almost the next breath
he had yielded to the call of his ambition; and in
his first walk upon the perilous path he had elected
to choose, he had shown an ease and lightness of
motion that were audacious, astonishing.</p>

<p>What was there to deplore? His triumph had
been so patent as to win the applause of the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
For the first time in his life money was in his pocket.
That woman of courage who had striven so heroically
for his welfare would meet with her reward.
She would be enabled to end her days at ease. In
those somewhat unilluminated eyes Money had always
seemed to divide the place of honor with Duty.
She would go to her grave, this upright and courageous
one, with a p an upon her lips, because her
son, her one talent, had in her old age been increased
to her tenfold. Those worn hands would need to
toil no more.</p>

<p>After all, this success, which to an honest nature
was so embittering, had a curious virtue of its own
if it could fulfil such an office. And it was hardly
for the like of himself to be troubled with these intimations.
Morality, like other privileges, was for
those who could afford to enjoy it; it was for those
who had a snug little annuity in the funds. Those
who had shivered in penury, who had known the
look of want, had purchased their right to walk unfearingly
by the light of their necessity. And he
had only parted with his dreams after all; he had
only transmuted airy nothings into explicit gold of
the state. Let the visionary who nourished his
heart upon the unattainable despise Crœsus as
before, but let the well-fed and valiant materialist
render due homage to that lusty and pagan old
fellow. You could not keep your cake and eat it;
you could not resign your ideals and yet hope to
inhabit your castle in Spain.</p>

<p>It always came back to the question of the Choice.
Was it not a sign-post that headed every path; did
it not denote the convergence and the parting of
every road? It was his own will which had selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
the broad and muddy highway of the many, instead
of the narrow and precipitous mountain ascent
which was only for the feet of the few. In a choice
of this kind there might be an affront to his nature,
but once having embraced it, it was weakness to
repine. He must shed this ferocious arrogance of
his. He was now of the common herd, no longer
of the sacred few.</p>

<p>The strangeness of his position held his thoughts
all day. That which he had purchased had been
obtained at a cost beyond rubies; it was not worth
one-half he had paid for it, but as he could never
recover his outlay he was bound to go on. It remained
for him now to play the part of the cynic
and philosopher. It was not the highest style of
the hypersensitive man on the defensive, but the
patchwork target would have to serve until he found
the cunning to provide himself with a more efficient
cover for his wounds. Yet when all was said the
shaft had sunk to a cruel depth in that quivering
nature. Heart and mind were lacerated.</p>

<p>At the table at the aerated breadshop at which
he took his lunch, two middle-aged clerks from a
city counting-house, musty, cowed, and solemn men,
were discussing the trial wherein the morning journals
with their unerring instinct had discovered the
element of sensation.</p>

<p>“——so she got off?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they brought in a verdict of not guilty.
My father-in-law was on the jury. He says it was
her lawyer’s speech that saved her. He says there
wasn’t a dry eye in the court, and the poor old
judge cried just like a child.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“Yes! He says he never heard a speech like that
before in his life, and he says if he lives to be a
hundred years old he will never forget it.”</p>

<p>“Who was her lawyer? Sir Somebody, K. C.,
M. P.?”</p>

<p>“My father-in-law says not. He says he was
quite a young chap without any reputation. But
such a voice—he says it just went through you
and made you shiver.”</p>

<p>“Something like Irving?”</p>

<p>“My father-in-law says he must have been acting,
yet there didn’t seem to be a bit of the actor
about him. That’s where he was so wonderful;
struck no attitudes; never even raised his voice.
Every word seemed to come straight out of him, as
though he just couldn’t help it, and yet at first all the
jury thought she was a thorough bad one.”</p>

<p>“So she was, I expect.”</p>

<p>“I dare say; but after what her lawyer had said
they never thought of bringing in a verdict of
guilty. My father-in-law says he was a wonderfully
read young fellow, and he must have known
the Bible almost by heart from the way in which
he used it in his speech. And such an eye as he
had too! My father-in-law says it looked like that
of an eagle; and when the jury retired to consider
the verdict the foreman, who had got a weak heart,
had to have brandy or he would have fainted dead
away.”</p>

<p>“It was very strange that the judge should have
died suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Excitement killed him, they do say.”</p>

<p>“You would think that a judge would be so used
to that sort of thing that it wouldn’t affect him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Well, my father-in-law has been many times
on the common jury, but he says this young lawyer
beat all he had ever heard. He says it doesn’t
matter how clever the ordinary lawyer may be, you
can always tell when he’s putting it on. But this
young chap was so quiet and solemn that he simply
made you shiver.”</p>

<p>“Just a trick.”</p>

<p>“They all knew that, yet he made them so that
they couldn’t help their feelings. My father-in-law
says as soon as they retired to the jury-room to
find their verdict, old Bill Oaks—you know the old
prize-fighter what keeps the Blue Swan at Hackney—who
was on the jury, he just spat in the corner
and wiped his eyes on his sleeve, and he says,
‘Well, mateys, I’d reckon we’d ’ang no more
women.’”</p>

<p>“Bill Oaks said that?”</p>

<p>“Those were his words. And it just shows the
power that young chap must have had to make a
common fellow like old Bill Oaks say a thing like
that.”</p>

<p>“Some men are born lucky. With a mind of that
sort he will have made a fortune in no time. In
a year or so he will be keeping his yacht and driving
his motor-car. It is a funny world when you come
to think about it. Here is a chap like me, been a
clerk in the Providential for thirty-five years. My
hours are nine-thirty till five; I have never once
been late, nor had a day off for illness; and my
salary per week is thirty-eight and a tizzey, with a
pound a week pension at sixty provided I keep up
my payments to the fund. I have never done a
wrong action as far as I know; I go to church once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
on Sunday; I teach in the Sunday school; I give five
shillings to the poor every Christmas; I have
brought up five children well and decently; I always
acted the part of the gentleman to my wife while she
was alive, and now she is dead I always keep fresh
flowers on her grave summer and winter; I’ve paid
my rates and taxes regular; the landlord has never
had to ask me twice for the rent; and what’s it all
amount to? Why, I leave off just where I began.
Yet I consider myself a cut above this young man,
with all his gifts, who will make a fortune by saving
murderers from the gallows.”</p>

<p>The speaker, a sallow, stunted little fellow, uttered
his words in a quiet, yet dogged staccato, as
though he were issuing a challenge which he knew
could not be taken up. His sharp, quaint cockney
speech was almost musical in its incisive energy.</p>

<p>“Happiness don’t depend on money,” said his
friend.</p>

<p>“You have got to have money, though, before
you can believe it.”</p>

<p>Northcote overheard this conversation while he
munched a sandwich. It afforded him the keenest
interest. He moved out into the eager crowd which
thronged the Strand. Yet again his old passion for
perambulating the streets came upon him. There
was a sense of adventure in dodging the traffic at
a breakneck pace, and in elbowing his way through
the press. Until the evening he wandered about
in the mud and the December mists. He was
sick and weary; the conflict within him gave him
no rest; yet there was a fierce joy to be gained in
mingling with the virile, many-sided life that was
about him everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>Thoroughly tired out at last, he took a frugal
dinner at a restaurant, and accompanied it with a
bottle of inexpensive wine. He lingered over his
meal and made an attempt to read an evening paper,
but found he could not do so. The vortex in which
his nature had been plunged absorbed the whole of
his thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIV<br>

<small>MAGDALENE OR DELILAH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> nine he returned to his lodging. He lit
the lamp, drew the curtains across the window, and
built up a good fire. He set himself to do three
hours’ reading before he turned into bed. However,
that power of will it was his wont to exert to
its fullest capacity was for once insubordinate.
There were not two consecutive sentences upon any
of the pages which he tried that displayed a meaning.
He had never known this impotence before.</p>

<p>In the midst of these futile attempts to fix his
mind on the task before it, he thought he heard the
creaking of the stairs. He listened acutely. Late as
was the hour, the clerk of some attorney might be
bringing him more briefs. A moment later his door
was softly tried and opened as softly as some one
entered the room.</p>

<p>To the profound astonishment of the young man
he saw that it was the figure of a woman. She was
tall and pale and clad sombrely in close black draperies.
Her entrance was somewhat stealthy, yet it
had neither reluctance nor timidity. Unhesitatingly
she approached the chair in which the advocate sat
with a book on his knee. He rose to greet her with
an air of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I knew you were a great student,” said his
visitor in a low voice, letting two large and dark
eyes fall upon the page of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“I beg your pardon,” said Northcote, “I am
afraid I don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“You do not know me?” said his visitor in a
tone that entered his blood. “I will give you a
moment to think.”</p>

<p>Northcote seemed to recoil with a half-born pang
of recollection which refused to take shape.</p>

<p>“I have not the faintest knowledge of having
met you before,” he said, feeling how vain was the
effort to fix his thought.</p>

<p>“Think,” said his visitor.</p>

<p>“It is in vain.”</p>

<p>“I should not have expected you to have so short
a memory,” said the woman. “You saw me yesterday
and you saw me the day before that.”</p>

<p>“I do not recognize you at all,” said Northcote
faintly.</p>

<p>“Should I have remembered that you were a
busy man who was unable to spare a thought outside
of his profession?”</p>

<p>There was something curiously stealthy in the fall
of the voice which startled the advocate.</p>

<p>“That is a voice I seem to recall,” he said, with
an air almost of distress.</p>

<p>“A voice you seem to recall,” said his visitor,
with a sombre laughter which made his heart beat
violently. “How strange it is that you should recall
it! You only heard it once, and that was in the
stifling darkness of a prison!”</p>

<p>Northcote gave a cry of stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Impossible, impossible!” he said weakly.
“You—you cannot be the woman Emma Harrison!”</p>

<p>“Emma Murray, alias Warden, alias Harrison,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
said his visitor, whose tone of gentleness was now
charged with deliberation.</p>

<p>“Then how and why do you dare to come here?”
cried Northcote.</p>

<p>“I bring you my thanks,” she said, with a sudden
consummate transition to humility. “I bring the
gratitude of an outcast to him who has delivered
her from a deeper shame than any she has suffered.”</p>

<p>At first the bewilderment of the advocate would
not yield; the revelation of the last creature in the
world he looked to see in his attic had seemed to
arrest his nature. But hardly had she rendered him
her homage with somewhat of the sombre dignity
of one who seeks by suffering to efface her stains,
than the old devouring curiosity of two evenings
previously returned to him. In the prison he had
not seen her face; in the dock he had not permitted
his eyes once to stray towards her. She was engraved
in the tablets of his imagination as a foul
and sordid creature, dead to feeling, yet susceptible
of the loss of freedom, horrified by the too-definite
thought of a barbarous doom; yet over and above
everything a denizen of the gutter, wretched, stupid,
and unclean. It was amazing to see her stand before
him in this frank guise.</p>

<p>Peering at her through the subdued flames of the
fire and the lamp, he saw that she had contrived to
inhabit her stains in a kind of chastity. It was a
trick of her calling, perhaps; yet if trick it was, it
was subtle, consummate, and complete. As far as
his eyes could pierce the texture of her secrecy, her
face was that of a woman of forty. It was pale and
unembellished; the cheeks were wan; the features,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
but slightly defaced, were possessed of a certain
original fineness of line, like the handiwork of some
little known craftsman who had been touched by
genius. There were the remains of a not inconsiderable
splendor strewn about her, particularly in her
dark, enfolding, and luminous eyes. Suffering was
everywhere visible, even in the hair, whose natural
sallow hue was peeping through its dye. In form
she was large, but not massive; ample, flowing in
contour, with the powerful, yet graceful, moulding
of a panther.</p>

<p>“Had you not expected something different?”
she said, standing up before a scrutiny he did not
disguise, and speaking with a mournfulness that
seemed to challenge him.</p>

<p>“You have guessed my thoughts,” said Northcote,
without lowering his gaze.</p>

<p>“I was not always as I was,” she said, letting
each syllable fall passionless. “I sank deeply, but
I am risen again. I am praying that with the aid of
one I may scale the heights. I even hope to reach
that which in the beginning was above my stature.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” Northcote muttered.</p>

<p>“That is cruel,” said his visitor with a shiver.
“Such a phrase from your mouth wounds me like a
sword.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I don’t understand,” said Northcote,
almost with indifference.</p>

<p>“This is not him whom I came to see,” said the
woman. “This is not him who saved my base
body; him who, if he will, may redeem my whole
nature.”</p>

<p>“I?” cried the incredulous young advocate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“You, my deliverer!”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think I like you; I think you had
better go away,” said the young man, with a brutality
of which he was unconscious.</p>

<p>The woman replied to this speech by sinking
slowly to her knees. She lifted the noble line of her
chin, which intense suffering had seemed to refine,
up towards him with an ineffable gesture of appeal.
It almost vouchsafed to him a sense of his own
degradation.</p>

<p>“I see you as the one whose noble strength will
heal me,” she said, prostrating herself more completely,
and clasping her arms about his ankles.</p>

<p>“Better rise, better leave me,” said Northcote,
bewildered by a sense of pity for his own impotence.</p>

<p>“You are striking me again,” said the woman
with a shudder that even to Northcote seemed
terrible, “but every blow you give may help to make
me whole.”</p>

<p>“What can heal a murderess, a prostitute?” he
asked, with a candor of selection that was intended
to lacerate.</p>

<p>“You. You who brought me out of prison—you
who delivered me from a shame to which even
I dared not yield.”</p>

<p>“Get up,” said Northcote, filled with an unaccountable
pang. “Sit there, and try to compose
yourself a little.”</p>

<p>With an indescribable impulse, which he had no
means of fathoming, he raised the trembling, shuddering
form by the shoulders, and let it into the
chair nearest the fire. The act was wholly without
premeditation, but there was nothing in it that partook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
of the uncouth harshness of his voice. A few
scalding drops crept out of her eyes on to his hands,
and when he lifted her the heat of her body communicated
itself to the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>“Oh, why do you not speak to me with the voice
with which you terrified my judges?” she moaned.</p>

<p>“I cannot make up my mind about you,” said
Northcote calmly. “I do not know whether you
are the Magdalene, or whether you are Delilah.”</p>

<p>“When you pleaded for my life before my judges
yesterday in the court, I looked upon you as Jesus,”
said the woman, pressing the tips of her fingers
against the balls of her eyes.</p>

<p>“At that hour I felt myself to be no less. And I
believe there were those among my hearers who
had that hallucination too.”</p>

<p>“Would <i>he</i> have cut me into pieces when I crept
to him for sanctuary?”</p>

<p>The young man pressed his hands to his sides.
An ineffable anguish had pierced him.</p>

<p>“No man ever felt less like that Nazarene than
do I this day,” he cried, with a face that was transfigured
with terror. “A holocaust has taken place
in my nature. I know that I shall never take my
stand with the gods any more. Henceforward I
am filled with roughness, brutality, and rage; I hate
myself, I hate my species.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore, O my prince!”</p>

<p>“Am I not fallen deeper than her I redeemed
from her last ignominy? Have I not prostituted
a supreme talent; have I not poisoned the wells of
truth?”</p>

<p>“Can this be he who preached the Sermon upon
the Mount? Can this be he who said to the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
taken in adultery, ‘Daughter, go thy ways, and sin
no more’?”</p>

<p>Already the roughness of the advocate was
melted into blood and tears. His callous rage had
yielded before the figure of the Magdalene. This
nondescript animal he had picked out of a sewer had
proved to be a woman who had bled for abasement,
and who strove for reinstatement by bleeding for it
again.</p>

<p>“I have a curiosity about your history,” said
Northcote, with a gaze that devoured her. “You
see you are pictured in my imagination as the denizen
of a slum.”</p>

<p>“I entered upon life,” said the woman, yielding
to the domination of his eyes, “as the eldest
daughter of an artist whose existence was a misery.
He was a painter of masterpieces that no one would
buy. He had not been in his grave a year when they
began to realize sums that during his life would
have appeared to him as fabulous. His two girls,
who comprised his family, never got the benefit of
the recognition that had been denied to their maker;
but the dealers in pictures, who had begrudged him
so much as oils and canvas, grew rich by trading
upon a great name.</p>

<p>“My childhood was bitter, cruel, and demoralizing.
Art for the sake of art was the doctrine
of my poor father, and in pursuing it he took to
drink. That honest and virtuous world which I
have never been allowed to enter, viewed him afar
off as an outcast, as an idle and dissolute vagabond,
as a worthless citizen, whose nature was reflected
in his calling. Perhaps he was all this; perhaps
he was more. Yet he would shut himself up in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
little back parlor in the squalid little house in which
we lived, and there he would work in a frenzy for
days together. He would emerge with his nerves
in rags, his skin pale, his eyes bloodshot, his linen
foul, his clothes and person in disorder, yet under
his arm was a new masterpiece, twelve inches by
sixteen, which he would carry round to a dealer,
who would bully and browbeat him, and screw him
down to the last shilling, which he already owed
for the rent. He would return home worn out in
mind and body by his labors; and for weeks he
was unable to bear the sight of a brush or a skin
of paint. It was then he would seek to assuage
his morbid irritation with the aid of drink. ‘They
will place a tablet over this hovel when I am dead,’
he would say, ‘but while I am alive the rope which
is needed to hang me outbuys the worth of this
tattered carcass.’</p>

<p>“My poor father, rare artist as he was, was
right in this estimate of himself. As a man, as a
father, as a citizen, I cannot find a word to say
for him. He never brought a moment of happiness
to either of his girls. He dwelt in a world
of his own; a beautiful and enchanted world, the
Promised Land of his art. He was a man of
strange ambition; of an ambition that had something
ferocious in it; of an ambition that was unfitted
to cope with the sordid and material aims,
by whose aid persons of not one-tenth part of his
quality achieved wealth, respectability, power, and
the fame of the passing hour. There was a thread
of noble austerity in my poor father’s genius, which
remained in it, like a vein of gold embedded in
the mud of a polluted river, throughout the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
time of his degradation and his ruin. His pride
seemed to grow more scornful with each year that
witnessed more completely the consummation of the
darkening and overthrow of his nature. I can remember
his saying of a picture by the president of
the Academy, ‘I would rather have my flesh pecked
by daws than prostitute myself with such blasphemies
as that;’ and at that time he stood upon
the verge of the grave of a drunken madman.</p>

<p>“I have said he was not a good citizen. Nor
was he a good father to his girls. He did not
offer them physical violence; but it never occurred
to him to shield them from the indignities thrust
upon them by want and debt, and the despair which
was sown in their hearts by the foulness of every
breath they drew. It would need my father’s own
gift to limn the picture of this beautiful talent living
its appointed life in its own way, yet indifferent
to the most elementary duties of a righteous parent
and an honest citizen. As a young man he had
been handsome, with a fine, delicate, even an entrancing
beauty; it was one of his favorite sayings that
the face of every true artist borrowed something
from heaven. I can only recall that face in its
latter days, when it was that of a petulant, arrogantly
imperious, yet hideous and bloated old
creature, whose body and soul had been undermined;
but from the numerous pictures he painted
of himself in his youth he had the divine look of
a poet.</p>

<p>“I have always considered it as both cruel and
ironical of nature that she should have bestowed
upon the daughters of this drunkard and madman,
a little of his own originality—divinity, that taint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
of genius, which brought him to the gutter. Look
at me well, my deliverer, and you will see what I
mean. If you choose you may read my dreadful
secret in my eyes; in the shape of my lips; in the
expanse of my nostril. It is there still, although
drink and the gutter have defaced its bloom. Look
at me, I say, and you will read my poor father’s history.
You will see in my face that ambition for
which he sought an anodyne in the drinking of
drams. Sometimes when he grew tired of painting
himself he would have me to sit to him, and he
would tell me I was amazingly like him in his
youth. He would also take my younger sister as
his model, but she did not interest him as much
as I. ‘Polly is destined for middle courses,’ he
would say. ‘She is neither good fowl, fish, nor
flesh. One of these days she will effect a compromise,
and will be admitted to membership of
the Great Trades Union.’</p>

<p>“‘As for thee, thou little slattern of a wench,’
he would say, running his fingers through my hair,
as he cuffed me affectionately, ‘I am afraid to
cast thy horoscope. I cannot predict what will become
of thee. Such a face as thine, thou dirty one,
is born to a dreadful and cynical hatred of things
as they are. I can see a bitter scorn in thee for those
hare-hearted rogues who run the show. Like thy
illustrious father thou wilt live to be a thorn in
the bowels of the canaille.’ I was too young at
that time to understand what was the meaning of
my illustrious parent, but often since, as I have
sunk from one stratum of my calling to another—there
are degrees in this profession of mine—have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
I recalled his words, and I have marvelled at his
power of seeing into the future.</p>

<p>“It was this father of ours, who before he deferred
to the hand of death, launched my sister and
myself upon our respective careers in the world.
There was nothing hypocritical or pharisaical about
this painter and lyric poet. In his heart he never
aspired to those principles which he denounced with
his lips. He sent our beauty to market as soon as
it had reached the age of puberty. He caused us
to cease the scrubbing of floors, lest it should
roughen our hands. We were turned out upon the
streets with rouge on our cheeks; for it seemed
to dawn upon him all at once, in one of his Titanic
flashes of inspiration, that there was a rational way
of obtaining money to buy the brandy for which he
craved during every hour of the day.</p>

<p>“After my father’s death, my younger sister
grew into a charming, accomplished, and beautiful
woman. In the course of time she aspired to the
prizes of her trade. For several years she lived in
refinement and luxury with a judge of the High
Court; and upon his demise was able to claim the
interest of a prosperous and clever criminal lawyer
of the name of Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“For many years now I have been dead to my
sister’s knowledge, for brutalized and sordid as I
have grown, she was the one thing in the world
besides myself I have ever been able to pity. Even
when I descended below my poor father’s level, I
could never find it in my heart to ‘queer her pitch’
as we say in the gutter. She grew happy and prosperous,
and forgot her childhood and all the sores
that festered upon her name. Long ago she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
achieved the beatitude of that condition of mental
and moral nullity as predicted by her distinguished
parent; while I, as also predicted by that seer, was
destined for sterner things.</p>

<p>“In those lucid intervals when drugs and drams
had left me the use of my faculties, I sought to
appease my cynicism by preying upon society. I
cannot reveal to you the cold rage I nourished
against the cosmogony that had been evolved by
I know not how many generations of Pharisees.
The lode-star of my father’s ambition was art for
the sake of art; that of her he had nurtured upon
it became crime for the sake of crime. Not that
I was wanton or petty in the workings of my creed;
like my father, I had usually some large aim in view.
Yet again like my father, it was not to myself that
material prosperity accrued from the exercise of
my gift, but to the crimps and bullies by whom I
was surrounded. It was one of these, a base, cold-blooded,
brutal, calculating ruffian, whom so treacherously
I did to death.</p>

<p>“I think I should enact that crime again; although
when my guilt was fastened upon me, and
I was brought into prison, my fear of the gallows
was terrible. It was even stronger than my poor
father’s dread of criticism of his works. And yet
as I lay under the shadow of a fate that I did not
know how to obtain the fortitude to accept, I
amused myself with a stroke of that wantonness
which has sometimes delighted my associates, and
on occasions has even rendered them respectful. I
chose Mr. Whitcomb to undertake my defence.
My poverty and evil repute made him reluctant to
accept the office, but like my father, I retain a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
of the artist’s power of seeing into the future. In
my dreams a voice whispered to me that he alone
could ensure my safety. And to my importunity
he yielded. He yielded to that importunity which
when I have felt called upon to exert it, no man
has ever been able to resist.</p>

<p>“What a sanctuary did this prison with its indescribable
gloom offer to me! All the days of
my life had been cast with drunkards, madmen,
thieves, panders, and prostitutes. They had rendered
the very breath of heaven unclean. From
one slum to another slum, from one gutter to another
gutter had my steps been traced. Will it
astonish you that what after all was a powerful
nature had founded its grand passion upon an irreconcilable
hatred of its kind? Yet I was brought
into prison, and for the first time I tasted the breath
of the living God.</p>

<p>“It was the horror of my doom, I think, giving
to a life that had never had any finite knowledge
the certainty of the surgeon’s knife, which
had the power to touch me for the first time with
the instinct of beauty. I am sure I know not
whether such was the case; but a pall was lifted
from my brain, a stealthy drug seemed to evaporate
out of my pores. There were times when I
lay behind the bars of this prison in which I could
have cried aloud for gladness. The open sores in
my nature began to heal. All those dark mysteries,
that had pressed me down like a curse, were
spread out before me luminous with meaning at
those hours when the dawn stole into my cell. Ere
long I would lie awake all night to watch for its
appearance, for I knew that every time it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
to me I should gain in knowledge. I began to
understand why the sun was warm, why the birds
sang, why the rain was wet. I began to understand
that to breathe, to move, to do, to think, to
say ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ to wield despotic powers,
to do battle with that underworld, that reflex action,
to which I had always been so ready to succumb,
were all acts of splendor and grace, all parts
of a living idea that was a noble solution of my
perplexity.</p>

<p>“As I lay behind the bars of my prison I
dreamed again and again of some mighty and enfolding
power that would take the whole of my
trembling irresolution in its arms and bend me into
the mould of its all-powerful will. I foresaw that
some young god would emerge out of those clouds
about heaven, which for the first time in my life
my enraptured eyes had perceived, that he would
break into my cell, that he would make me the
bride of that majestic loveliness which had caused
my sight to shed its first tears.</p>

<p>“When you came and spoke to me in darkness
in the prison I knew who you were. I knew that
my dreams had yielded a reality; and that the new
birth which had unfolded itself in my nature had
already found a shape. From that hour of our
meeting I thought no longer of my doom. Now
that such a one had consented to plead for me
I knew that none could do me hurt. Even the
dock itself was powerless to touch me with fear;
although until you rose to speak I could neither
hear nor see, and I did not know where I was.
But at the first sound of your voice I sat entranced.
I forgot that my wicked and degraded life was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
your hands; I forgot that a subject so foul was
the source of your beautiful words. I had never
known before what the living voice of poetry was
like. I had never beheld those heights to which
a great and noble nature is able to aspire.</p>

<p>“As you spoke in the court and all my enemies
hung upon your words, you became a part of this
miracle which had happened in myself. You were
the breathing embodiment of those august shapes
which emerged in all their order and beauty from
behind the dark curtains of my nature. Hour by
hour, as I listened to the enchantments of your
voice, it seemed to steal over me that you, my deliverer,
in the empire of your youth would not only
free me out of prison, but also you would deliver
me out of the bondage of my own soul. Such a
tumult of joy came upon me then as I could not
believe could visit any human creature. The music
of your lips was not only the earnest of my dreams,
it was the consolation of my stains.”</p>

<p>When the woman had finished her story she
rested her elbows on her knees and her chin on her
hands. Northcote, who had followed so strange a
recital with an interest which its attendant circumstances
even rendered intense, felt no longer able
to withhold an ample meed of pity. And how unfathomable
it appeared to him that his defence,
which had been inspired at a time when all was
darkness concerning her, should yet be vindicated
so completely by the facts of her life. Such an
intuition was an uncanny weapon. Who could
wonder that this buffeted, arrested, slowly maturing,
late-developing creature should see in its
transactions the revelation of a supernatural power?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
She was base and foul, yet she was suffused with
the inspiration of his strength—with a strength
that had been used in ignorance, with a sordid end
in view. She must indeed engage his pity, she
who had prostrated herself before a chimera, she
the thrice unhappy one who had prostrated herself
before an idol with feet of clay.</p>

<p>In looking at her now she had lost half of her
strangeness, half of her mystery. The foulness
and ugliness that must recently have been stamped
upon her was now effaced. He could not doubt
that since she had been brought into prison her
nature had been sanctified by a new birth. This
squalid criminal whom life had pressed out of the
ranks had actually gained eyes to see and ears to
hear. Such a confession was not a charlatan’s trick;
this enkindling experience of the divine beauty was
a true renascence; a cleansing of a fœtid heart
by the instinct of joy. Faith in its childlike
naïveté had appeared by some miracle amid that
expanse of corruption. It was as though a violet
had raised its head in a sewer.</p>

<p>Now that the young man had become the witness
of the phenomenon that he himself had
wrought he was abashed, yet also he was sensible
of recompense. Not in vain had he suffered those
creative pangs by which so strange a thing was
born. Fame and money were the only guerdons
he had sought to compensate his gifts in their highest
walk; yet that travail of the mind, that expenditure
of spirit were to receive emolument more
fitting. This wanton, with her crimes and her sores
upon her, whom he had delivered from the last
indignity her fellows could devise, would issue from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Gehenna healed and purified into the mellow light
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Northcote had suffered extreme misgiving
throughout that day, but now as he stood to gaze
upon her who was undergoing a resurrection by the
wand of his genius, he felt an exquisite joy in this
special and peculiar gift that heaven had vouchsafed
to him. It had wrought beyond his knowledge.
This genie which had derided and tormented
him had achieved an intrinsic glory in allowing
itself to be called to the highest, the most disinterested
of human offices. Here was the apologia
for the art he had practised. The black magic in
which he had dealt, the shame of which had stricken
him, had actually wrought a divine miracle. In
the light of its sanction he need repine no more.</p>

<p>“It is truly wonderful,” the woman muttered
softly as if to herself, “to live forty years without
knowledge and without curiosity, and then to awake
in a night to the seas of color, the harmonies of
music that make the enchantments of the life we
have never perceived.”</p>

<p>“You are like a bird,” said the young man,
“who has been born in a cage, yet who contrives
at last to break through its bars. It flies into heaven,
mounting rapturously into the void, and it sees the
sun, the tops of the trees, the green fields, the
fleecy clouds, and it tastes the bright air.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and hears for the first time the free and
joyous songs of its kind.”</p>

<p>They seemed to pause to look upon one another
with violently beating hearts: the man in his
strength, in his insolent domination; the woman
in her weakness, in her pitiful need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“Strange, is it not,” said the young advocate,
speaking aloud his thought involuntarily, “that
I should not be acquainted with your history when
I made my appeal?”</p>

<p>“Would it have been made had you known all?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” said Northcote, with a fervor
in which he tried to rejoice; “your baseness is now
less in my sight than it then was.”</p>

<p>The fierceness of the woman’s breathing arrested
her speech.</p>

<p>“You force me to believe,” she cried in choking
accents, “you show me what faith is, you unfold
the meaning of affirmation. Never again can I be
nourished by denial. You are, indeed, the Cloud-dweller
who in my vision I saw break forth out of
the stars.”</p>

<p>The sword with which these words pierced the
advocate was too sharp for his fortitude. His
wounds of that day had left him faint and spent
with the blood that had flowed from his veins.
He grew frail and numb.</p>

<p>“You had better hear the truth,” he said, gasping.
“It is the death-knell of us both, but there
is a limit to mortal endurance. I would have you
divorce the instrument from his works. Your
Cloud-dweller is not a god, but even as yourself
a thing of dross and clay.”</p>

<p>“I deny it, I deny it,” said the woman, in a
voice of passion.</p>

<p>The man seemed to cower before the anguish of
her eyes.</p>

<p>“You owe your deliverance to an unworthy instinct
which rendered me invulnerable.”</p>

<p>“Unworthy, my deliverer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>“A thousand times unworthy, poor deluded one.
It was not for the sake of the abandoned wretch
who was presented to my mind, that I bought her
life and freedom. It was not for her, it was not
even for her cause that I spent the last drop of my
power.”</p>

<p>“It was not, then, a divine magnanimity that
taught you to forget my stains?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It was not that you drew your sword for a
marvellous gospel—for a gospel that dazzled the
poor outcast in the dock with its magnificence?”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“Then why did your voice seem to wail like a
flute? Why did you pluck the back of your hands
until the blood flowed from them? Why did you
conclude in a whisper so gentle that it could only
be heard by the spirit?”</p>

<p>“I was in a frenzy of avarice. I was fighting
for myself.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Your words were inspired from
heaven.”</p>

<p>“No, no! It was no more than the baleful
power of the earth. I was fighting for a roof over
my head, regular meals, a reputation, material
needs.”</p>

<p>A thrill passed through the eyes of the woman.
They seemed suddenly to be blinded by a thousand
black thoughts she had half-forgotten. She sprang
to her feet, possessed by an excitement that he who
had made his pitiful confession was afraid to
plumb. She placed her hands on his shoulders and
peered into his face; and he did not shrink from
contact with her, for by some occult power, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
was her own genie, her own special and peculiar
gift, he was disarmed.</p>

<p>“You have the voice, the bearing, of a god,”
she said, quivering with terror, “but your speech
belongs to the underworld whence I have come.
Persist in it and we return to it together, walking
hand in hand.”</p>

<p>The advocate strove feebly to escape from the
demonic faculty which already had been exerted
upon him. She resisted him mournfully.</p>

<p>“You cannot put me off, my deliverer. Henceforward
your ways are my ways. I go with you
to the bright fields of your native kingdom, or I
return to the horrors of my own. I beseech you to
take me by the hand and lead me along the golden
paths to those mountain fastnesses in which you
were born, in which the sun shines forever. You
know how I have been dreaming that some saint
and hero would lead me to them; you must make
my dreams come true again, my deliverer, as you
did but yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you come to me?” cried Northcote
weakly, as he strove in vain to free himself of
the yoke that was already on his neck.</p>

<p>He seemed hardly to understand that he had to
deal with a desperate gambler who was staking all
upon a final cast.</p>

<p>“Do not let me perish,” cried the woman. “Do
not say this is an illusion upon which I have built
my miraculous faith. Do not tell me that the gods
walk the earth no more!”</p>

<p>The tragic distension of her countenance filled
the young man with horror, yet also with a sense
of its weird poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>“You must not hurl me back into the abyss out
of which I have crawled with bare life,” she cried,
seizing his hands with an astounding passion.
“You are the god who has breathed upon the poor
outcast who knows no heaven apart from your nobility;
you cannot, you must not, reject her.”</p>

<p>Again the wretched creature sank down upon
her knees before him.</p>

<small>DELILAH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Northcote gazed upon her, despair beat him
down like a flail. It was not for him, man of
genius as he was, to heal this outcast with his touch.
Only a perfect chastity could do that; and this was
the jewel with which he had parted two days before
to save her from the gallows. If he touched
her now, it would be as the inhabitant of her own
level. She cried for the living god, yet now he
was become a counterfeit of arid clay. She had
asked for bread, and he had only a stone to yield.</p>

<p>“You must go,” he said, and the words seemed
to thicken as they fell from his throat. “You must
fly from me. I have nothing to offer you.”</p>

<p>The woman shuddered and clasped him by the
ankles, but otherwise made no sign that she had
heard.</p>

<p>“My power is gone,” he said. “I am no longer
the strong and valiant one, but the poor outcast
even as are you. Two days ago I flung my birthright
away.”</p>

<p>“Will you send me back to the charnel-house?”
said the woman with a low moan.</p>

<p>Northcote drew up his body rigidly, erectly.</p>

<p>“I have no choice,” were the words that were
forced from between his lips.</p>

<p>Vein by vein the creature before him was invaded
by death. She crouched lower and lower upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
ground until she was no more than a shapeless and
ignominious mass on the bare boards in front of
the fire. Every line of her body was merged and
outspread into something amorphous, without form.
Her helplessness was too complete to arouse pity.
Such a flaccidity was greater than that of an infant,
whose frame is too puny even to allow it to
crawl.</p>

<p>Northcote had no disgust. He had too sharp a
sense of horror that the power should be denied to
him to succor such an invertebrate thing. Presently,
by an effort which seemed to shatter her flesh,
the creature was able to move. She rose from her
knees, issuing from the state of coma with all the
heavy and desperate pangs of one who attempts
to throw off the fumes of a deadly venom. She
rubbed her eyes with the back of her hands, and
folded her arms in front of her.</p>

<p>“If you could have touched me once with the hem
of your garment you would have healed me. As
it is, I walk back with my wounds into the world.”</p>

<p>A singular change had occurred in the voice of
the suppliant. It was far other than that which
had clothed the language of entreaty which had
previously fallen from her lips. In the ear of Northcote
the change wrought relief. Yet even as he
imbibed this clear, this definite, this pungent tone
with the eagerness of one who presses cold water
to his throat at a time when the pangs of his thirst
have become insupportable, a rapid and bewildering
transformation took place in her who confronted
him. She who a minute ago had presented the
appearance of a nebula, suddenly broke out all over
into light like a star. Out of the sprawling shapelessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
there was seen to issue something as
strong, graceful, and agile as a leopard. The hue
of her skin became luminous as though a fire had
been kindled beneath it; and her eyes, which so
lately had been dull and without nascency, shot forth
a lustre that added light to the room.</p>

<p>There was nothing baleful or malevolent in an
apparition so profoundly wonderful. In standing
aside to witness the evolutions of any force, in the
act of obeying the laws by which it is governed,
however inimical its operations may be to our personal
safety, the feeling of repulsion bears no part.
The spring of the tiger, the long white teeth of the
wolf, the pinions of the eagle, the motions of the
serpent, are in themselves beautiful, for in them
are manifested the free and unconquerable expression
of that force which nature has taken for its
highest gospel. The wide and curving nostrils of
the prostitute were the mansion of a subtle but
brutally dominating power.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, Northcote was only
aware that a splendid, supple, and entrancing thing
had stolen unperceived, like a beast of prey, into
the room. The strong, fine, and beautiful line that
had been traced along the convergence of the thin
but full lips addressed him like an unexpected but
supreme artifice of a great painter, who has learned
to use his pigments with effrontery.</p>

<p>As a revelation of power she was more than his
equal; she challenged him with eyes whose insolent
domination exceeded his own. Furtively, yet
boldly, she had discarded her stealthiness; she had
already the strength that disdains a mesh. She
looked upon him now with the same hidden but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
imperious scornfulness with which he had looked
upon the judge, the jury, and the bar under the excitement
his speech on her behalf had generated.
Strong, subtle, and secure as he had been in the
exercise of his specific and audacious talent, this
siren was equally so in hers. He had delivered a
great prostitute from the gallows in order that she
might lead him to it.</p>

<p>“I came here with no thought of destroying you,”
she said.</p>

<p>With perfect composure she proceeded to divest
herself of her hat and coat, and carried them confidently
behind the curtain, as though already she
were perfect mistress of his house. When she returned
she seated herself in the chair against the
fire.</p>

<p>Northcote had not protest to raise. He could not
meet the challenge in the eyes of Medusa. In their
baleful lustre he had read the abrupt limit to his
own imperious will, he beheld as through a mirage
the prefiguration of his own doom. Even as he
had conquered others by the fearlessness of his own
quality, he had himself been conquered by the fearlessness
of hers. He was no common advocate,
but this was no common harlot. Prayer and devotion
alone could have saved him from toils such
as these; but of prayer and devotion he no longer
commanded the use. There was a fissure in his
armor; and through that aperture, small as it was,
the deadly, unnamable thing that had crawled into
his room had been able to plant its look.</p>

<p>“I am trying to think,” said his visitor, as she
reclined in the chair with her elbows outspread and
her hands clasped behind her hair, which was profuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
and ordered with rare precision, “I am trying
to think what it is about you that has caused me to
love you. I do not think it can be your voice altogether,
for although when it chooses it can sound so
low and delicious, it can also sound harsh and rude.
No, my noble warrior, I think there is a deeper
cause. Is it not that our natures are alike? Are
they not so similar? We are not of the common
herd. We can think, we can feel, we have a little
knowledge, and do we not possess enormous powers
of resentment? Life has not been very gentle
with you and me, but we will not complain about
it much. Can we not quietly choose our own
weapons and go our own way to work in order
that we may avenge ourselves? It is for your
strength and spirit that I love you. Give me a
kiss.”</p>

<p>Northcote obeyed.</p>

<p>She caressed his hands with an extreme tenderness.</p>

<p>“How strong, square, massive, and beautifully
ugly they are!” she exclaimed. “I am sure you
could fell a bullock if you doubled your fist. I love
you even for these. I would rather be strangled
by strong hands than I would be fondled by weak
ones. If you cared to drive your fist into the
world, you could knock a hole in it and let out a
few of its wrongs. How tall and young and splendid
you look. And strength means bravery.”</p>

<p>Her words, the careless complacency which accompanied
them, the ease of her posture with her
head thrown far back in the chair and her eyes
directed steadfastly to Northcote’s face, filled him
with a cruel sensation of pleasure. Knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
translated into the grace of physical perfection had
an all-conquering attraction for his nature. Every
blemish upon her, and as she lay back in the shadow
of the lamp they appeared surprisingly few, were
additions to her value. They were so many receipted
acknowledgments of the heavy sums she
had paid for what she possessed. There was a
short but deep scar over one eye. There was a
suggestion of coarseness in her jaw; her bust looked
a little too full.</p>

<p>“What shall I call you?” said the young advocate
with shining eyes. “Shall I call you
Diomeda?”</p>

<p>“Do, my beloved Achilles!”</p>

<p>“How do you come to have heard about him?
Is it that Greek is compulsory in the University
of the Gutter?”</p>

<p>“Achilles was perfectly familiar to me before
I attended it. My dear father used to tell us stories
from Homer when he was drunk.”</p>

<p>“Well, Diomeda, I have come to believe that
your father must have been a very remarkable
man.”</p>

<p>“The world will arrive at a similar belief two
hundred years hence. But how can you have
acquired such an important piece of information
concerning him when you have never seen one of
his works?”</p>

<p>“Do not forget that for the past hour I have
been gazing upon his <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>, the masterpiece
among his masterpieces.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, my beloved, you are judging
him by his one great failure. In conception, in
design, I have no peer in this time of ours, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
inspiration of the artist failed suddenly and lamentably
before he could touch me with the magic that
would have rendered me immortal. I am a splendid
thing, my beloved, but I shall perish. Therefore
the artist has failed.”</p>

<p>“This is a masculine intellect of yours,” said
Northcote, who was captivated by the celerity with
which she had interpreted an idea that in his own
mind had still the nebulosity of recent birth. “Is
it usual to your sex to have such powers?”</p>

<p>“You will confess that you would not say so?
Are they not eternally dunces and fools in the
austere eyes of the male?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I make that confession if you insist
upon the measure of my ignorance.”</p>

<p>“Say rather, my hero, the measure of your inexperience.
You see you have only studied those
of my sex who are affiliated to the Great Trades’
Union. They take eternal vows of foolishness and
duncishness before they are admitted to membership
of that sanctified order. But with us black-legs
it is different. We are allowed to know everything.
You may not know that in our University
of the Gutter we have the most learned staff of
professors in the world. There is a chair for everything.”</p>

<p>“Except for honesty. If there was a chair for
that, would there not at once be an end to your
intellectual subtlety?”</p>

<p>“You do not know the great university to which
I have the honor to belong if you think intellectual
dishonesty is tolerated among us. The moment
we become intellectually dishonest we have done forever
with Alma Mater. She sends us down immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
and there is nothing for us then but the
river or the Great Trades’ Union.”</p>

<p>“That is what the world would call being ‘sent
up.’ Yet if the simplest terms were not subject to
totally different meanings in the varying strata
of our society, we should not have so many of
these pretty paradoxes to subsist upon. But I feel,
Diomeda, that I am entitled to ask you one question.
Was it in my capacity as a mentally dishonest
person that you came to me to-night to ask me to
arrange for you to be ‘sent down’ from your
university?”</p>

<p>“Answer that question to your own liking, beloved
one. It was your appeal on my behalf that
brought me here to-night. Would you have me ask
whether you were mentally honest when you made
it?”</p>

<p>Her laugh had an edge that cut him like a keen
blade. But she was quick to read the sharp thrill
of pain that made his eyes grow dark.</p>

<p>“Do not repine, my beloved Achilles,” she said
with a softness that had the power to caress, “I
found you after all to be as honest as I am myself.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said the young man, sensible that
even her lightest caresses possessed the ferocity of
those of the snake and the tiger, “you are the first
of your sex with whom I have conversed who appears
to understand the uses of paradox.”</p>

<p>“There is no other means by which the honest
mind can carry on its thinking.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case, you conduct the thinker to
his doom with atrocious certainty. You conduct
him to the gutter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“That is true, O Achilles,” said the woman with
a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>“In other words,” pursued Northcote, “he demonstrates
in his own person the impossibility of a
reconciliation in any terms whatever between the
ideal world of the spirit and the material world of
the flesh.”</p>

<p>“Why trouble to put it into so many words, dear
lad? Briefly, I am the child of the poor drunken
man of genius, my father; and I suspect that you
had a poor drunken man of genius for your father
also.”</p>

<p>“I would have you to know that my father was
ordained a clergyman of the Church of England.”</p>

<p>“How old was he when he died?”</p>

<p>“About thirty.”</p>

<p>“Did it never occur to you that the poor fellow
killed himself in the struggle to become an honest
man?”</p>

<p>“These eyes of yours are dreadfully piercing.
I remember my mother saying of him that the clock
of his intellect was always set a little too fast.”</p>

<p>“She never informed you by any chance, dear
lad, that if he had not taken an overdose of opium
he would have died a lunatic?”</p>

<p>“Or that he killed himself with drinking brandy
after the manner of your own illustrious parent.
By the way, you have yet to give me a description
of your mother. Can you recall her?”</p>

<p>“She died, worn out, I believe, by slavery when
I was about four years old. She reminded me of
a cow; her eyes were so placid and her movements
were so slow. But she had been affiliated to the
Trades’ Union from her earliest days. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
she was a life member with her policy or whatever
they call it—I have no first-hand knowledge—fully
paid up. She was buried in consecrated
ground in Kensal Green cemetery with wreaths on
her coffin in consequence. Non-members of the
Union are mostly buried in a prison or in the
Thames. And now about your mother, the clergyman’s
widow? She, I presume, would be a vice-president
of the Union, or on its committee, or one
of its trustees, or she might even aspire to be one
of its honorary secretaries? Her social rank would
render it necessary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear old woman,” said Northcote softly.
“She is on the committee right enough. As you
say, her social rank has rendered it necessary.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVI<br>

<small>THE HONORABLE SECRETARY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning Northcote was late
for breakfast. When the old charwoman shook his
curtains at a quarter to eight, a sleepy voice murmured:
“I may be a bit late. I will cook the bacon
myself and make the tea. Lay a knife and fork
for two and don’t stay.”</p>

<p>It was between ten and eleven o’clock by the time
he had completed his toilet. And it befell that at
that hour the kettle was singing on the fire, and he
himself was kneeling before it, toasting pieces of
bacon upon a fork, when there came a knock on
the door of his room.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he called cheerfully.</p>

<p>He expected to see an attorney’s clerk with
further business for his attention.</p>

<p>Instead, two persons entered whose appearance
caused him to drop the fork and the bacon among
the ashes.</p>

<p>A moment ensued in which he had to fight with
all his resolution to regain his self-possession. The
first to enter the room was his mother, and immediately
behind her was the young girl whom he was
under a pledge to marry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Northcote was a tall, strong woman, past
fifty, with assured movements and a resolute-looking
face. It was large and rather square. Her
cheeks were red with country life; her hair had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
streaks of white in it; her eyes were bluish gray.
Her clothes, severe in outline, fitted close to her
broad and powerful frame. They helped to sustain
a somewhat rural appearance, which was not
altogether unprepossessing and had a sort of education
in it. Her speech was decisive, while the
voice was somewhat harsh, and left an impression
that it would be easy for it to domineer.</p>

<p>The young girl who accompanied her was not
moulded in these Amazonian lines. She was
straight and slender, only a little above the medium
height, neat of hand, delicate of foot. Her complexion
could only have been produced by generations
of country air. It was perfectly clear, and of
an exquisite tawny pinkish whiteness. Her eyes
were large, soft, and long-lashed, and although as
clear and bright as a pair of crystals, as meaningless
as those of a dumb animal. Her simple straw
hat and thick gray coat and skirt were in themselves
innocent of coquetry, but their inhabitant was in
her kind a sweetly beautiful thing—half-child and
half-woman—therefore these articles, rough and
primitive as they were, had significance in every
crease and fold.</p>

<p>The moment Northcote had managed to strangle
the first pangs of his stupefaction, he rose from his
knees and ran forward to greet them. He kissed
his mother on both cheeks, and seized both of the
young girl’s hands in his own.</p>

<p>“I could not believe my own eyes,” were the
first words he spoke to his mother. “You should
have given me warning that you were coming up
to London, my dearest. It is the merest chance
you have caught me at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>“It was not until last evening that we decided
to come,” said Mrs. Northcote. “Margaret had
happened to see the advertisement of an excursion,
only eight shillings here and back.”</p>

<p>“Why not telegraph, my dear?” Northcote expostulated
gently. “I would then have met you at
St. Pancras.”</p>

<p>“It would have cost sixpence,” said his mother.
“Besides it was too late last night.”</p>

<p>“Always the woman of action,” said her son,
with a hollow laugh. “Always an arbitrary and
drastic old woman in the execution of her ideas.”</p>

<p>Northcote kissed his mother again with the pride
and affection which for the moment overlay this
wound.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said she, with an air of one who
has come upon something profound, “why men have
such a dislike to being taken by surprise. Your
father was the same, Henry. He could not bear to
be taken by surprise in anything. And I think you
are wonderfully like your father in some things.”</p>

<p>“What is your opinion of this room of mine?”
said her son abruptly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I like it,” she said decisively,
after making a catalogue of everything with an
immensely critical glance. “It has a dismal look.
And a hole in the roof, I declare! You must have
it mended at once; it might help you to catch a
cold. And you are right up at the top just under
the tiles; I should think you must get frozen in
winter. And it must be extremely draughty with
those cracks in the door. And, my dear boy, I must
say it looks very bare and untidy with not even a
piece of carpet to the floor. I have meant for years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
to come and see you; and when I received that
money you so kindly sent me, I thought now or
never is the time. How I wish I could have come
before, to have made you a little more comfortable!”</p>

<p>“How I wish you could, old woman!” said
Northcote gently, taking both her hands.</p>

<p>“I think this room is rather sweet myself,” said
the girl, who also had been examining it very
critically. “Somehow every room looks sweet
with a nice fire and a lot of books.”</p>

<p>“That unnecessarily large grate takes all the
heat up the chimney,” said Mrs. Northcote, “and
moreover is very wasteful of the coal. And what
have you got behind the curtain, Henry?”</p>

<p>“That is where I sleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is sensible, my boy; a saving of
money.”</p>

<p>“What a large room this must be altogether!”
said the girl, with a sudden growth of her curiosity.</p>

<p>“I can see neither of you will rest until you have
penetrated into the heart of all my mysteries,” said
Northcote, laughing loudly, as he interposed himself
between the entrance to his chamber and his
mother, who, full of inquiry, was plucking at the
curtain.</p>

<p>“Why, Henry,” cried the girl, with a thrill of
consternation in her voice, “you have not had your
breakfast!”</p>

<p>“Why should I? This is not Chittingdon, you
know. Eleven o’clock is the fashionable hour in
town. It wants ten minutes yet.”</p>

<p>“Bad habits,” said Mrs. Northcote solemnly.
“My dearest, eleven o’clock is wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>“When one is in Rome you must do like the
Romans, you know.”</p>

<p>“I have never agreed with that proverb,” said
Mrs. Northcote. “I consider it weak. When in
Rome one should make the Romans do as one does.”</p>

<p>“Imagine me knocking at the gates of Buckingham
Palace at a quarter to seven.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure, my dear boy, the royal family
is addicted to good habits. I am quite sure you
would not find the king having his breakfast at
eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this dear dogmatic old woman of mine,”
said Northcote, tapping her cheek in tender remonstrance.
“A fixed rule and a definite opinion for
everything under the sun.”</p>

<p>“You must have fixed rules and definite opinions
if you are to succeed, my dear boy. Those who
have their doubts always end by failing miserably.”</p>

<p>“So they do, old woman, so they do!” cried
Northcote fervently, in spite of being stabbed by
consternation. Yet he never conversed with his
mother on the most trivial topics without feeling
that her simplicity rendered her invulnerable.</p>

<p>“I see your table is laid for two, Henry,” said
the girl. “Are you expecting a friend?”</p>

<p>“If he comes, he comes,” said Northcote, with
a clever assumption of carelessness, “and if he
don’t he stops away. Do you understand, Miss
Inquisitive? I generally have an extra knife and
fork, you know, in case a friend should happen to
drop in.”</p>

<p>“He will have a wretched breakfast this morning
if he comes,” said the girl, taking off her gloves
gaily, and fishing out the fork and the bacon from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
among the ashes. “I must say, Henry, whoever
your friends may be, they cannot be very nice about
their cookery.”</p>

<p>“Consecrated by the cook, don’t you see, Miss
Impertinence. That bacon is toasted by mine own
fair hands.”</p>

<p>“Really, my boy,” said his mother, “you have
grown most Bohemian in your ways.”</p>

<p>She took off a pair of shabby and much-mended
gloves with that air of resolution she imparted to
her lightest action, and insisted on being allowed
to make the tea. She measured two spoonfuls of
tea from the caddy with great care.</p>

<p>“I allow myself three spoonfuls now I live in
London,” said her son.</p>

<p>“Three is extravagance, Henry, three is not necessary,”
said his mother quietly. “One for each
person and one for the pot is correct.”</p>

<p>“Suppose a friend turns up?”</p>

<p>“More can be made. I fear you have formed
very bad habits in London.”</p>

<p>“We have a surprise for you, Henry,” said the
girl gaily.</p>

<p>She left the room to fetch a basket she had left
at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Guess what we have brought for you,” she
cried as she produced it.</p>

<p>“Butter and eggs.”</p>

<p>“How awfully clever that you should have
guessed them at once,” she said, with her eagerness
sinking into disappointment.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I never had any tact worth mentioning,”
said Northcote. “It was very stupid of
me to have guessed butter and eggs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“But we have brought you some holly as well,”
said Margaret, a little mollified. “Christmas will
soon be here.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad I was not clever enough to guess
holly,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>The contents of the basket were unpacked and
laid along the books on the writing-table. He had
to submit, not without a passage of arms, to having
an egg cooked for his immediate delectation.
His mother also insisted on being allowed to toast
him a slice of bread.</p>

<p>“You are spoiling me completely,” said Northcote,
being forced at last into making a pretence
of eating after his own half-hearted offers of hospitality
had been uncompromisingly repelled.</p>

<p>By an effort of the will that seemed superhuman
to himself he forced himself to swallow a few
mouthfuls, yet as he did so he followed the smallest
movements of his guests. One eye never left the
curtain that ran across the room. Whenever one
or the other of his too curious visitors was seen to
approach it incautiously he made ready to spring
to his feet.</p>

<p>The only alleviation to the bareness of the walls
was several photographic groups of football-players,
over which velvet caps decorated with tassels
were suspended.</p>

<p>“See that group in the middle?” said Northcote.
“Look at it well. That is the finest pack that
ever turned out for England. We walloped Wales
twenty-nine points to three. Pushed ’em all over
the shop. Notice that little chap sitting between
my legs. He was a half if you like. Cunning as
a trout and quicker than a hare.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>“I think, my dear boy, this is perfectly uninteresting,”
said his mother, fixing her spectacles
and examining the photograph sternly. “This is a
stupid pursuit, not only a waste of time, but also
a waste of money. It has been the ruin of many
young men. One of these days it might even prove
to be the ruin of England.”</p>

<p>“All work and no play, my dear,” said her son,
“makes Jack a dull boy, you know. Personally I
would suggest that a game like football is a rare
training for the character.”</p>

<p>“I think football is a fine and manly game,
Henry,” said the girl, with a little air of defiance.
“I shall never forget seeing you come home with
your twisted knee.”</p>

<p>“The doctor’s bill was thirty pounds,” said Mrs.
Northcote simply.</p>

<p>These words, spoken in a manner that was almost
childlike, came upon Northcote with the force of
a blow. He was perfectly accustomed to his
mother’s voice and manner, that voice and manner
which were so direct and so unqualified. But for
the first time they had driven a deep flush of shame
to his cheek. This dauntless unimaginative creature,
who measured spoonfuls of tea, who counted
pennies, whose staff of life was hard facts, what
had she not performed at the call of her religion?
What lions had she not removed from the path of
this one ewe lamb of hers, in order that one day
he should win his way to the kingdom she had
designed for him? Night and day, year after year,
had she labored with this object in view. He was
her only son, and material greatness was to be his
destiny. He recalled the unflinching figure of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
woman tramping over the moors in the depth of
winter, through rain and wind, through frost and
snow, to earn a pittance by her tutelage; he recalled
the resolution with which she performed the meanest
household duties in order that money might be
saved; he recalled her sitting beneath the insufficient
light of a lamp through the midnight hours,
transcribing, for the sake of a few miserable sovereigns,
foreign masterpieces out of their native
French, German, and Italian into trite, colorless,
and rather wearisome English prose. All in an
instant Northcote seemed to be fascinated, overcome,
by the sudden revelation of the pathetic
beauty of the commonplace.</p>

<p>“I won’t have you think I have become idle and
extravagant,” he said, rising from the table and
placing both his hands on her shoulders. “You see
I have had to fight my battle, and a long, a stern,
a lonely one it has been. What was I in the midst
of six millions of fighters, most of them as sturdy,
as fierce, and, in many cases, far better equipped
than I was myself? But I must tell you, my dear,
I believe I have conquered at last. I think I have
got the turn of the tide. If health and strength
remain to me, and never in my life have I been
physically more robust than I am at present, I am
about to make an income at the bar which, to frugal
people like you and me, mammy, will seem fabulous
wealth. For I ought to tell you I won my
first big case the day before yesterday, and I think
I am entitled to say I made an impression.”</p>

<p>“I know that you saved that poor woman, my
dearest boy,” said his mother, with a tenderness
that was almost grim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>“Tell me, by what means did you learn that?”</p>

<p>“I walked over to the Hall and borrowed the
<i>Age</i> of Sir John.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Age</i>!” said her son, in a tone that had
a thrill of horror in it. “Why walk all that distance
to the Hall to get a look at the <i>Age</i> when
Parson Nugent would have been only too pleased
to lend you his <i>Banner</i>?”</p>

<p>“The reason is this, my dear boy,” said his
mother impressively. “All my life I have been
accustomed to look upon the <i>Age</i> as the first English
newspaper.”</p>

<p>“I expect you are right, you dear old Amazon,”
said her son, strangling a groan.</p>

<p>“No, Henry, I am not right. I am prepared to
believe there was a time when the <i>Age</i> was the first
English newspaper, but in my opinion it is so no
longer. I shall never place my trust in the <i>Age</i>
again.”</p>

<p>“A heavy blow for Printing Press Square,” said
Northcote, laughing to restrain his tears.</p>

<p>“I consider that leading article it had about the
trial, and the terms in which it referred to you, my
boy, to be a disgrace to English journalism. In
fact, I wrote to the editor to say so.”</p>

<p>“What did you find to say to the editor?” asked
Northcote feebly.</p>

<p>“I said it was contemptible that a newspaper of
such a widespread influence as the <i>Age</i> should lend
itself to a faction whose aim was to suppress young
men of talent.”</p>

<p>“And what had the editor to say to that?”</p>

<p>“Very wisely he did not reply. Perhaps I was
somewhat severe in my letter, but I felt very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
strongly upon the point and I do not regret that I
expressed myself at length.”</p>

<p>“In the name of wonder, what else did you say
to the editor?”</p>

<p>“I said this faction of which I complained had
been very mischievous in its influence in this country,
but in the end it had always failed in its object,
as in the end, Henry, everything that is merely
negative and destructive and retardatory must fail.
I cited the cases of Benjamin Disraeli and the poet
Keats.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Northcote, with a dull sense of
agony overspreading his veins, “it could not occur
to you, old woman, that by any possibility the <i>Age</i>
was justified in the course it took?”</p>

<p>“It could not, Henry,” said his mother.</p>

<p>Her air of finality bewildered him. Yet involuntarily
he raised his eyes to her face, and, for the
first time in his life as he looked at it, he was able
to penetrate through its heroic commonness. The
features were harsh and aggressive and scarcely lit
by the mind, but the rigidity of such a nature in
the teeth of public opinion had appeared to shed
over them a little of the bloom that proceeds from
the elevation of the intellect. It was a kind of
apotheosis of the power of faith. Her eyes were
deep blue, strangely unfearing and clear, wide-lidded,
steady in their gaze. It was little enough
that they had the capacity to see, but whatever
they lacked in range derived compensation from
mere force of vision. They were inaccessible to
the changes which are wrought by influences from
without. Whatever they had looked on once could
never be modified by external causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>Northcote carried the toil-stained hand to his
lips with a reverence that was more profound than
any he had ever felt for it before.</p>

<p>“Every man needs to have known one truly
good woman,” he said, strengthening his grasp of
the roughened fingers, “before he can even begin
his own education.”</p>

<p>It darkened his eyes to see the muscles of the
harsh face relax as they yielded to the slight softness
of an infrequent emotion.</p>

<p>“Your father was constantly making speeches
like these,” she said, with that simplicity which was
so formidable. “I was never able to understand
them.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVII<br>

<small>INDELIBLE EVIDENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time Northcote stood holding her hand
and looking down into her eyes. A sense of deep
wonder was percolating slowly to every part of
his being. What a haven was here to embrace when
the frail bark of his nature had been flung, like the
cockle-shell that it was, upon the crest of tempestuous
and multitudinous seas. How blind and undeveloped
he had been not to have understood this
before! From what ignominy could this anchorage
have saved him! It would not have been necessary
to founder upon the shoals had he been
aware of this harbor that would have been so willing
to embrace him. He was already broken into
pieces; and those tears which appeared to suffuse
his eyes with such facility and to suffuse hers with
such a painful reluctance were falling from him.</p>

<p>“You must ignore that unmannerly attack in
the <i>Age</i>,” she said in a stern voice which yet was
full of redress. “The enemies of the friendless
have no kingdom into which they can enter. A
few years hence, when you are a rich and honored
man, you will forgive them for having once stabbed
you.”</p>

<p>The silence which followed her words was broken
by the hard and intense breathing of the figure that
clasped her.</p>

<p>“There is one thing I shall ask of you,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
Northcote at last. “I shall ask you to give me the
pledge from your own lips that you will always
believe in me as completely as you do at this moment,
whatever doubts, charges, or suspicion the
future hurls against me.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary for me to give this assurance,
but, since you demand it, I give it.”</p>

<p>“It is part of my weakness to demand it,” said
her son, “although none is so well aware as am
I that there is no need to give expression to your
faith.”</p>

<p>“As you say, there is no need. But I remember
your father saying to me shortly before that illness
which was fatal to him, the greater the gifts the
greater the lenity to be meted out to their unhappy
possessors. On that account I have always treated
you with more indulgence than otherwise I should
have done.”</p>

<p>“Had you been more Spartan you might have
strangled the genie at its birth.”</p>

<p>“I might.”</p>

<p>“And yet made of its possessor a more upright
and God-fearing citizen.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible.”</p>

<p>“You never could conceive of his being other
than you see him now?”</p>

<p>“I could not.”</p>

<p>“Even if the indelible evidence were laid before
you?”</p>

<p>“Evidence is never indelible to us. So-called
facts have no worth in our eyes. We believe or we
do not believe. Nothing changes our emotions;
they are what we understand by religion.”</p>

<p>“You speak for wise and great women.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>“I speak for the humblest of wives and mothers
who cannot accept credit for blind obedience to an
instinct which alone gives her life.”</p>

<p>“I begin to understand why even the most imperious
natures, which are as ruthless as volcanoes
in action, cannot live without your aid. It is not
that you enslave and fetter them; your function is
to cleanse, renew, rehabilitate.”</p>

<p>As Northcote spoke a feeling of profound joy
overspread the humiliation whose penalties had
been far more grievous to him than those of
despair. Hardly had he tasted it, however, than
the nightmare at the back of his thoughts assumed
a visible shape. Of a sudden there came a sharp
screech from the curtain. Margaret, who throughout
the conversation with his mother had been engaged
in fixing pieces of holly over the photographs
on the wall, was still employed in this decoration.
It was not she who was responsible for the sudden
shrieking of the brass rings along the curtain pole.</p>

<p>With a single comprehensive movement the curtain
had been flung back and the bed revealed.
Seated upon it, half-dressed, with her hair hanging
loose, and her bare arms exposed by her chemise,
was his visitor of the previous night. Half a
dozen hairpins were stuck in a row in her mouth.
In the cold grayness of the December morning,
which seemed to envelop her malignity in a bald
realism, her features appeared blunt, pale, and hideous.
The almost incredibly bitter and mocking
glance was not directed upon the man, but upon
the elderly, unprepossessing, and countrified figure
in the shabby clothes and antique hat whom he was
holding by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>Northcote let the hand fall, and recoiled from
his mother with a gasp of fear mixed with passion.</p>

<p>The young girl, whom life had done nothing to
enlighten, stood in dumb amazement upon the chair
on which she was poised.</p>

<p>There was a moment in which the older woman
quivered with terror. The brutal eyes of the prostitute,
fixed upon her face with a blunt contempt,
seemed to change her into stone. Observing her to
be petrified like a bird in the presence of a serpent,
the woman seated upon the bed picked the row of
hairpins from between her teeth with the circumspection
of an actress who, upon the stage, is notorious
for her power, and who, having a stupendous
scene to enact, prepares her audience for it by a
display of quietude. She proceeded to coil up her
hair with a deliberation that had value as drama.</p>

<p>“Vice-president of the Great Trades’ Union,” she
said, removing the last hairpin from her mouth.</p>

<p>The elder woman stood looking helplessly away.
Those indomitable eyes were cowed for the first
time in their history. For the first time they had
come upon something upon which they had no opinion
to deliver. She had barely the strength to carry
her gaze to her son, who stood ten paces from her as
pale and rigid as a statue.</p>

<p>“Better go—better take Peggy,” he whispered
in a voice that she did not know to be his.</p>

<p>Margaret, still holding the holly, had come down
from the chair, and like a child had come to stand
at the side of her natural protectress. She was
visibly afraid; and she had clutched the holly so
tightly that blood was trickling from the wounds in
her soft fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>The spectacle of her childishness restored to the
elder woman that capacity for action which she was
never without.</p>

<p>“Get your coat and gloves, child,” she said in
her harsh tones. “Where’s the basket?”</p>

<p>She herself took up the basket, and, without venturing
to look at her son or her who sat upon the
bed, neither of whom had changed their postures
nor spoken again, she led the way out with resolute
steps to the top of the stairs. The young girl followed
in her wake with a timid obedience, pulling
on her cotton gloves over her bleeding fingers as
she went.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs this new resolution of
the elder woman’s appeared to fail her.</p>

<p>“Go down, child; take the basket. I will follow
you in a minute,” she said, handing the basket to
the girl.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly and went back into the room.
Her son was still standing in the attitude in which
she had left him. There was a curious glare in his
eyes. Advancing to him she placed her hands on
his shoulders, pressed her lips against his forehead,
and then, in a kind of headlong flight, darted away
like a rabbit out of the room and down the stairs.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVIII<br>

<small>CLEANSING FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> irrational proceeding served to liberate
Northcote from his thrall. Even as he felt his
mother’s lips and witnessed her ridiculous flight,
he was able to divine the nature of the impulse. It
was the expression of that unconquerable instinct
by which her sex affirms itself.</p>

<p>He walked to the window which commanded a
view of the pavements below. He watched the two
figures mingle in all their rustic quaintness with
the heterogeneous streams of persons and traffic
which defiled before his gaze. It followed their
every deviation among this ruthless swarm of Londoners
until they were swallowed by the mist of
the December morning. The last detail he was able
to discern, which served to emphasize their slightly
ridiculous character as seen from this altitude, was
the large empty basket bobbing about in the hand
of the girl. Their rusticity in combination with
the wild hurry of their flight marked them out as
almost grotesque among the spruce and purposeful
crowd through which they made their way. With
a pang he remembered that neither of them had
ever seen the metropolis before. Whither were they
flying? How would they spend their day? What
would be the end of their ill-starred adventure?</p>

<p>He continued to strain his eyes after them until
they grew dark with the effort. He then left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
window and turned round to find that his visitor
was standing in front of the fire. She was yawning.</p>

<p>“A facer for the old Methodist,” she said, with
a short, nonchalant laugh.</p>

<p>Northcote clenched his hands. An almost ungovernable
fury caused his ears to sing.</p>

<p>“I know what is in your mind,” said the woman
calmly. “Get it done.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will go,” said Northcote in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“Get it done,” said the woman. “Tear my head
from my body and I shall respect you.”</p>

<p>Northcote was barely able to point to the door.
The woman looked at him with supreme effrontery.
She was utterly divested of fear. Her nostrils
seemed to be dilated in scorn, and her dark eyes
were full of mockery.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything half so funny,” she said,
“as the worthy old widow of the clergyman running
back shamefaced to kiss her saint and hero.
The three of you made a picture for an almanac,
as my dear father would have said. You reminded
me of nothing so much as a stuck pig. The dear
old hymnologist and psalm-singer, who had spoken
such brave nonsense, looked just like a poor silly
old cow with a red face; and that stupid little baby-face
sticking up the holly, well, she was just like
one of those silly dolls with wax cheeks, which has
a button which you press and it changes its color.”</p>

<p>Northcote was faint already with the dreadful
struggle he was waging. Suddenly, as if touched
by inspiration, he turned in the direction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
door. Yet the woman was too quick for him. She
leaped before him and barred his course.</p>

<p>“I am asking you to pluck my throat out with
your great hands,” she cried with fury. “Don’t
you understand, you fool? Don’t you understand,
I say? I cannot, I will not go back to the gutter;
yet I cannot go anywhere else. Why don’t you
do as you are told?”</p>

<p>“Do go!” he cried weakly, piteously. The
veins were swelling in his neck.</p>

<p>He strove to thrust her aside, but she resisted
him; and when he tried again she fixed her strong
teeth in his hand ferociously.</p>

<p>“Do it now!” she cried, watching his eyes with
the baleful hunger of a she-wolf.</p>

<p>“You are not worth it,” said Northcote, recovering
possession of himself.</p>

<p>She spat in his face.</p>

<p>Northcote began to realize that he had to deal
with a mad woman.</p>

<p>She plucked a knife from the table. By this time,
however, the man had all his wits about him, and
the movement was anticipated. He had seized her
before she could make use of it.</p>

<p>He knew immediately that he had entered upon
a terrible struggle. He possessed immense physical
power, but the creature upon whom he had to exercise
it was extremely supple and vigorous, and,
above all, was now a maniac. She fought with the
fury of a lioness. Her unbridled rage seemed to
make her more than a match for him. Screaming
foul oaths, and resorting to devices that a wild
beast would not have employed, the issue hung in
the balance. Inch by inch, however, he obtained a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
stronger purchase on her body, and it writhed under
his great hands like that of a huge snake. He
grunted under the Titanic exertion of forcing her to
the ground. He shifted his hands to her throat, and
once he felt it yield to their gripe, his own pent-up
fury broke forth in an uncontrollable manner.
Hardly conscious of what he did, he shook her
with the passion of a wounded bear. She gave a
low moan, and a spray of blood came on to her
lips.</p>

<p>It fell upon him with a shock of surprise that her
struggles had ceased. She had fallen stiff under
his hands. When he relaxed his grip she fell to
the ground, measuring her length with dull heaviness
like a sack of flour. In an instant a revolting
idea stifled the dreadful frenzy of the demoniac.
She was dead. Those enormous hands of his had
pressed out her life without knowing it.</p>

<p>Overcome with horror, Northcote sank to his
knees beside the body. It was stark, and already
a little cold. He rolled the corpse over, so that
its face was exposed; he felt for the beating of the
heart. There was not a movement of any sort to
enkindle his touch. The face was convulsed, tinged
with purple, mottled with gray. The eyes were
glazed, and even more hideous than when he looked
into them last. In his anguish, he gave a little cry,
and rose from his knees, and pressed his hands to
his head.</p>

<p>His first thought was for himself. By this irrevocable
act he was destroyed. His dreams had
come to a brutally abrupt termination. That high
destiny which was to shake the world had petered
out in a shameful public ignominy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>In a pitiable state of terror he fell on his knees
again. There was a sort of morbid reflex action
within him that seemed to draw him back to the
body, to force him to pass his hands across the
corpse. It was now cold. A stinging fury made
him writhe. Was it for this foul, uncanny monster
that he must forfeit one of the most precious jewels
that had ever been devised by nature? He was a
young man; life was before him; there was the
magic talisman in his spirit that could bend the
whole world to his purposes. He gnashed his teeth
with impotent fury, and rose biting at his nails.</p>

<p>“This is a dreadful tragedy,” he muttered.
“This is a dreadful tragedy. Think of such a one
as myself being lost to mankind.”</p>

<p>His own grotesque words caused him to laugh.
That surprising genie, that had been destined to
conquer a stupidly material world, enabled him to
present himself to himself in his amazing predicament.
He could hardly preserve his gravity before
a spectacle so astonishing.</p>

<p>“The genie is deriding me,” he said.</p>

<p>That mute and distorted face that was looking
up at him with an insane leer had no message of
its own. It was only significant to the advocate
as the price of all that he was about to give up.
Yet suddenly he remembered this strange creature
he had broken with his hands as he had first encountered
her in the prison. In no animate thing
could the desire for life have been more intensely
strong. Overmastering as was his own desire
at this moment, hers, at that time, had been no less
so. She must have life; she must see the sun and
the clouds and the trees. The common earth had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
acquired fresh symbols for that debauched vision.
And how nearly she had come to possess this
strange new thing that she craved. One heaven-born
man had all but given it to her. He had so
nearly done so, that for one brief instant she had
been able to taste it with those blood-stained lips.
And when she had discovered that strong and shining
as this one man was, his was not the divine
valiance of those early mystics who roamed the
hills in the childhood of the world, that he had not
the simplicity to provide her with that which she
craved, she insisted on receiving death at his hands
in lieu of the life he could not give her.</p>

<p>It was then, that he took a little compassion. It
was a loathsome and terrible destiny to which this
human being had been called. By what subtle twist
or abrogation of her noble faculties had she come
to live her days on such lines as these. This avowed
and ruthless enemy of society had been of no common
or spurious clay. It was not a small nature
that had taken a revenge so bitter. A little more
and it had been how much? Another grain of courage,
another ounce of power, and she, too, poor
maimed and twisted thing of beauty, would have
been numbered among the valiant.</p>

<p>It added a sharp touch to her slayer’s compassion,
that, in regarding her mutilated image,
she became the mirror of his own. He saw the
parallel between the living and the dead. Every
point in this analogy was so perfect that a mental
fascination lurked in its rendering. Did the texture
of his own fate admit of any more lenient inquiry?
He also would have entered his kingdom had he
but possessed the little more that meant so much.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
Were they not both in the beginning the victims
of a fine and original talent, for she whom he had
slain had been the offspring of a man of the first
genius. Her thoughts were his thoughts; her desires
were his desires; the tragedy of each had
been that their fineness had been immolated upon the
altar of its base surroundings; both had failed to
scale those precipitous mountain-places from which
alone it was possible to stand in true perspective
to their own characters.</p>

<p>As he pressed home this analogy with that curious
grim subtlety that was always one of his chief
pleasures to employ, he began to feel in his own
veins that intense desire of hers to live the life that
nature had appointed, to discover an ampler, a truer
self-expression. How was it possible to arrest
those functions that had not had an opportunity
to fulfil themselves? There was a ravishing vigor
in his blood; he must not perish as a felon, he to
whom all things were so full of meaning.</p>

<p>The overwhelming force of these thoughts translated
them into action. It had already come to him
that to obey his overmastering desire he must conceal
his deed. He raised the heavy corpse in his
arms; yet powerful as he was it proved too much
for him to bear. Therefore he dragged it across
the room, and with herculean labor contrived to
hoist it on to the bed. He then drew the curtain
across to hide it from the view of those who should
chance to enter the room. Afterwards he proceeded
to ponder the evolution of a means to ensure his
own personal security.</p>

<p>He was still engrossed with this occupation when
the old charwoman entered his room. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
brought him some clean linen. It was contained
in a basket which it was her custom to deposit on
a chair behind the curtain at the foot of his bed.</p>

<p>“You can leave it here, Mrs. Brown,” said
Northcote, indicating with his finger a place on the
floor.</p>

<p>“I had better take it out of the way, sir,” said
the old woman. “Besides, I have not made the
bed.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the bed,” said Northcote; “that
won’t matter at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, it would never do for you not to
have your bed made,” said the old woman, in a
tone of quiet but determined expostulation.</p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t want it made,” said Northcote.
“You can go.”</p>

<p>The tone of his voice seemed to strike the old
woman. Formerly he had always been kind and
gentle to her; he had never used such a tone to her
before.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” she said meekly, looking at
him with scared eyes.</p>

<p>Still, however, with a perversity which in the
circumstances he could only regard as diabolical,
she did not go. For suddenly she recollected that
the day before she had lost her shawl, and it occurred
to her now that it was not at all unlikely
that she had left it beneath the bed. It was not
in the least probable that she would find it there,
but one of those irrational side-currents to mental
activity, which science finds so baffling, had suggested
to her that she might.</p>

<p>“What do you want now?” cried Northcote,
as she moved towards the curtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>“I want my shawl, sir.”</p>

<p>Her meekness exasperated him beyond endurance.</p>

<p>“Where is your shawl?”</p>

<p>“I think, sir, it might be under the bed.”</p>

<p>Her hand was already stretched towards the curtain.
Northcote was standing against his writing-table,
and near his elbow was the leaden paper-weight
which he used for the destruction of rats.
He took it in his hand and poised it in a fashion
that would enable him to hurl it with all his force
at the back of the old woman’s head.</p>

<p>For some occult reason she withdrew her hand
from the curtain, and retired without pulling it
back.</p>

<p>“Of course I remember now,” she said. “I lent
my shawl to Mary Parker while the snow was
about. I have such a bad memory,” she added
plaintively.</p>

<p>“There is one little errand I should like you to
do for me,” said Northcote, looking at her calmly.
“Do you mind fetching me a gallon of paraffin?
You can get it at an oilman’s or an ironmonger’s.
I am going to try a new kind of fire.”</p>

<p>He handed her half a crown.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>As he listened to her descending the stairs with
little toddling steps, he balanced the paper-weight
thoughtfully in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>“Those five grandchildren will never come much
nearer to the workhouse, you perverse old woman,”
he said with a whimsical laugh.</p>

<p>He had already formed his plan, and like all
subtle minds which yearn for a finality which they
so seldom obtain, the definiteness of its nature enhanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
his capacity for action. He discarded his
carpet slippers in favor of boots, and set his hat,
gloves, and overcoat in a place where he could take
them up immediately. He placed the briefs confided
to him by the solicitor carefully in his pocket.
There were no other portable objects of value belonging
to him except a quantity of large and loose
manuscript sheets, numbering some two thousand
pages, the “Note towards an Essay on Optimism,”
that fruit of six years’ labor. These he collected
from divers drawers in the writing-table, and piled
them into one upstanding heap.</p>

<p>He stood surveying this proud edifice with a rueful
smile when the old woman returned at last, bearing
a gallon of paraffin contained in a tin.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, taking it from her. “You
may keep the change. If I spoke to you rather
roughly just now, I hope you will not mind it.
The fact is, I have a great deal of work to get
through, and it has made me rather irritable.”</p>

<p>The old charwoman, immensely mollified by the
tone in which she was now addressed, thanked him
humbly, and after standing a moment irresolutely,
in which she further considered the question of
how far it would be now expedient to attempt the
making of the bed, a daily duty which with all her
soul she yearned to perform, decided it would not
be politic to reopen the subject. Therefore she retired
crestfallen, because she had failed to carry
out a régime which was the foremost function of
her life; yet a little exalted also by the apology
which had been so feelingly rendered to her by one
who wore a nimbus; and above all, tremulous with
excitement by reason of having ninepence in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
pocket which was pure gain, a solid lump of
treasure-trove.</p>

<p>As soon as she had gone, Northcote “sported
his oak” and locked the door. It was indeed necessary
that he should not be disturbed in his labors;
and he took elaborate precautions to render them
effectual. First he broke up all the chairs he possessed,
and strewed the fragments over the corpse.
He pulled down the curtains, and flung them upon
the pyre. He gathered several armfuls of books
of jurisprudence and philosophy, dilapidated articles
which had been purchased second-hand, tore
them in pieces, and strewed them about. He pulled
a wooden box from under the bed, flung out the
contents, consisting of old clothes, and having
broken up the box into splinters, heaped those up
also. Finally, he gathered in his arms that formidable
bundle, the “Note towards an Essay on Optimism,”
and sprinkled its two thousand leaves upon
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>By pressing into service every combustible article
the room contained, the pile that he built mounted
up to the roof. Having arranged the great mass
to his satisfaction, he poured the paraffin over it.
He then kindled one of the splinters of the chair
into a fagot, and applied the lighted end to one
of the saturated blankets of the bed. He then ran
to the door, catching up his hat and coat as he
did so, and unlocked it. Barely had he time to do
this ere the whole of the pyre, under the excitation
of the oil, had burst into a sheet of flame. He
changed the key, and locked the door after him.</p>

<p>Putting on his hat and coat and gloves he walked
down the four flights of stairs, past various open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
doors with clerks behind them, yet in so doing
betrayed neither sign of haste nor discomposure.
At the bottom of the last flight he was accosted by
an elderly lame man, who bore unmistakable traces
of being the clerk of an attorney.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if Mr. Northcote’s chambers
are on the top floor, sir?” he asked courteously.</p>

<p>“My name is Northcote. Can I be of service to
you?”</p>

<p>The clerk opened a small bag that he carried, and
selecting an oblong piece of paper from among
half a dozen similar documents lying within it,
handed it to the advocate.</p>

<p>“Messrs. Peberdy, Ward, and Peberdy, No. 3
Shortt’s Yard, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Northcote, placing it in the inner
pocket of his overcoat.</p>

<p>At that moment a clerk from one of the upper
stories came running down the stairs.</p>

<p>“The place is on fire,” he cried. “The top landing
is so full of smoke you can’t go up to it.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was a smell of burning,” said
Northcote. “I say, it must be my room!”</p>

<p>“If you are Mr. Northcote, it is certainly your
room.”</p>

<p>The advocate turned round hastily, and proceeded
to ascend the steep and rickety old stairs. He was
turned back, however, as he had anticipated, by
other clerks who were running down.</p>

<p>“The place is on fire,” they cried excitedly.
“The smoke will choke you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIX<br>

<small>WITHOUT FEAR AND WITHOUT STAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Northcote</span> made no further show of resistance
to the inevitable, but accompanied the excited clerks
into Fleet Street. The window of his room abutting
on to it had already attracted the notice of the
crowd that thronged its pavements. By the time
he had crossed to the other side of the road and
had taken up his stand with the knot of spectators
that was rapidly assembling at the end of a bystreet,
the smoke had increased considerably in
volume.</p>

<p>“Not much doubt about there being a fire,” was
the verdict of those around him.</p>

<p>The bunch of witnesses in the side street increased
every instant. Persons riding on the outsides
of the omnibuses stood up to look. Policemen
on point-duty came out of the press of the traffic
to gaze with concern and inquiry at the smoke
which now was belching forth in a black mass.</p>

<p>“Must ha’ begun in the chimbley,” said one of
Northcote’s neighbors, a man without a collar.
“That’s soot.”</p>

<p>“It’s Pearmain’s Hotel,” said another.</p>

<p>“No,” said a third, “it’s Shepherd’s Inn.”</p>

<p>“If it’s Shepherd’s Inn it will take it all,” said
a fourth. “It has been condemned by the County
Council for the past two years. It is so crazy it
can hardly stand up in a gale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>“It is rotten and rat-ridden from top to bottom.
It must be five hundred years old.”</p>

<p>“Five ’undred me leg,” said the man without a
collar. “It ain’t more than two.”</p>

<p>“Lord Bacon lived in it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Wot if he did? I tell you it ain’t more than
two.”</p>

<p>The controversialist spat on the pavement authoritatively,
and those who surrounded him, who
knew he was wrong, deferred to his opinion humbly.</p>

<p>“There’s the flame,” said a quiet man excitedly.
“Why don’t they bring the engines?”</p>

<p>“They want it to get a firm ’old,” said the man
without a collar, “so that they can put it out in
style.”</p>

<p>“They will have something to go at when they
do come,” said a nervous man, who wore spectacles.
“There it goes through the roof. Look,
look, see that!”</p>

<p>There could be no measure of uncertainty as to
the power the fire had acquired already. Smoke
and flame were pouring and leaping out of the windows
and through the old red tiles into the dull
December sky. A stern joy held Northcote as he
gazed. Every instant of delay increased his chance.
It needed a holocaust to ensure his safety. He derived
that thrill of impersonal satisfaction which
visits a good craftsman when a work is placed
before him which has been adequately planned and
executed.</p>

<p>“The engines ought to have been round from
Fenchurch Street afore now,” said one, whose
mustache bristled like that of a county councillor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>“Fenchurch Street, did yer sye?” said the man
without a collar. “Lord love me, they’ll send ’em
round from ’Olborn.”</p>

<p>“They are taking a lifetime about it,” said the
nervous man in a voice of intense anxiety.</p>

<p>However, at that moment there sounded a curious
rattle of warning; policemen came running up,
and immediately afterwards came the first of the
engines. The crowd was now dense and the traffic
was impeded. In the next few moments it had been
stopped altogether and diverted into side streets.
By now a large posse of constables had appeared,
and they succeeded in clearing a space in which the
firemen could carry out their operations. Before
the hose had been placed in position two other engines
had arrived.</p>

<p>Northcote had managed to place himself in an
admirable situation among the excited throng; and
although those in front of him were somewhat
roughly thrust back by the police, he was able to
maintain his coign of vantage. By the time the
first spray of water had been flung upon the conflagration,
it had not only burnt through his room
into the story beneath, but also it had spread some
twenty yards along the tiles.</p>

<p>“If it takes to burning down, it will be awkward,”
said a voice near him.</p>

<p>“How it is spreading! They will find it difficult
to keep it off the hotel.”</p>

<p>Northcote, in the midst of the frenzy of destruction
that possessed him, now grew conscious that a
hand had gripped his arm. He managed to turn
his head sideways and discovered that his old
schoolfellow, Hutton, was standing next to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>“This crazy old hole has been waiting for this,”
said Hutton. “It burns like tinder. If there are
any poor devils who keep there, I pity them.”</p>

<p>“I’m one,” said Northcote quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, I call that really bad luck,” said his old
schoolfellow fervently. “Upon my word, it will
take the whole place.”</p>

<p>“Job’s comforter,” said Northcote.</p>

<p>“I say though, it is a blaze! By Jove, it has got
into the hotel! It will take half Fleet Street if they
don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“More engines,” said Northcote with satisfaction,
as their hideous rattles pierced the air. “Well,
they will all be wanted.”</p>

<p>“I say, though,” said his companion, with the
growing excitement of his surroundings communicating
itself to him, “this is going to be really
awful. It has got down another story, and it is
certainly in the hotel, and if they don’t look out it
will be in the bank.”</p>

<p>Although half a dozen engines had arrived by
this time and the supply of water was copious, the
fire had spread on all sides with such alarming
rapidity that the liquid sheets that were flung upon
it seemed only to increase the virulence of the flames.
The surrounding buildings were all more or less
decrepit, while the old inn itself had not the slightest
resistance to offer to the flames. The whole of
its quadrangular roof, most of which lay behind,
appeared, as far as the onlookers could discern, by
now to be involved.</p>

<p>“There is something strange, fascinating, exhilarating,”
said Northcote with a thrill of exaltation
in his voice, “in witnessing a really great fire. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
fire of London must have been the finest sight the
world ever saw.”</p>

<p>“You don’t appear to mind very much about your
rooms, I must say,” said his companion. “If I
were looking on at the destruction of my goods
and chattels and the roof that protects my head, I
don’t think I should be able to raise much enthusiasm
for the spectacle.”</p>

<p>“It will probably take half Fleet Street. What
is my wretched little attic in comparison with
that?”</p>

<p>“Somehow in the circumstances I don’t think
I could play the philosopher myself.”</p>

<p>“It is all up with the hotel,” said Northcote.
“It will be into a few of these newspaper offices
before long. Conceive a holocaust that places the
press of England in danger! Ha, ha, there goes the
roof of my room!”</p>

<p>“Why, that is where the fire began! You don’t
mean to say the fire began in your room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is where the fire began.”</p>

<p>“No! How did it begin? Were you in it when
it started?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was in it when it started.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“I started it myself.”</p>

<p>“Did you overturn a lamp? Or did it begin in
the chimney?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know,” said Northcote, “you
shall hear the true facts. A lady called upon me
last evening, and very kindly stayed the night. But
this morning when I wanted to turn her out she refused
to go. And further, she showed temper and
made herself distinctly objectionable. Therefore I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
lost patience with her, and being a man of my
hands I twisted her neck. But when I had managed
to do that—by Jove, it is into the bank! we shall
soon be able to reckon the damage by a cool million
and it has only just begun!—but when I had managed
to twist her neck, the question arose how to get
rid of her remains. You see to have her unvirtuous
person found in my room would not help this
career at the bar I am just about to begin. How
could I get rid of the body, that was the question?
Now mark the really fertile mind of genius. Why
not burn down the whole place? And that, you see,
is exactly what I have done, although I will admit
the idea is a plagiary from that excellent old author,
Charles Lamb. You remember his Chinaman who
burnt down the house of his parents every time he
wanted to eat roast pig?”</p>

<p>“Well, North, you have a pretty mind, I must
say,” said his companion to whom this recital, in the
circumstances which attended it, had afforded keen
amusement. “But you were always a bit of a
lunatic at school. Now if you had tried to persuade
me that you had insured your furniture, and that
you had fired your place to keep out an execution,
I might have tried to swallow it.”</p>

<p>“That is mediocrity all over, my son,” said
Northcote, linking his arm through that of his companion.
“It is always craving for hard facts. It
cries aloud for hard facts; they are the staff of its
life, its daily bread, but you have only to present
hard facts to it in a somewhat unconventional form—my
God, look at the bank!—in a somewhat unconventional
form, and it flings them back in your
face and asks you what you take it for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>“My dear old lunatic, what <i>are</i> you talking
about?”</p>

<p>“Merely this. Your alternative of the insurance
company and the furniture is ingenious but lacking
in comprehensiveness. The insurance company
would, after the fashion of insurance companies,
have insisted on an investigation into the cause of
the disaster; they might even have preferred a
charge against me to save themselves a few wretched
shillings; litigation would almost certainly have ensued—there
goes the roof of the hotel!—and litigation
which touches myself is the last thing I
should be willing to risk.”</p>

<p>“All this is very elaborate, North, but it is
hardly convincing. Why are you so unwilling to
risk litigation when your whole life—and a rather
important one I expect—will be bound up in it?”</p>

<p>“The less my name is associated in the public
mind with any shady transaction the better for my
career.”</p>

<p>“A point of honor, North. You always had the
reputation at school of being rather nice about it.”</p>

<p>“To be frank, it is a point of expedience, my son.
Henceforward you will find the notorious ‘Cad’
Northcote without fear and without stain.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why! Because one of these days they will
make him a judge.”</p>
